   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideMultiple chelated configurations of anionic groups offer a great chance to design new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with excellent performances for infrared (IR) application. In this work, the new polar Ln3LiMS7 (Ln = rare-earth; M = Ge, Sn) family as promising IR NLO candidates were successfully designed and synthesized by the unique close-ring combination between LnS8 and MS4 ligands. Note that La3LiGeS7 and La3LiSnS7 exhibit the good NLO effects (0.7 vs 1.2 × benchmark AgGaS2) with phase-matching behavior and high laser damage thresholds (6.0 vs 2.5 × AgGaS2), respectively. First-principles calculation indicates that their NLO effects originate from the synergistic effect of intrinsic dipole moments and d-p delocalized-π electron-induced dipole oscillations in the Ln3LiMS7 family. This result also verifies that unique unilateral-chelated configuration induced d-p-π interactions are beneficial to improve the NLO performances, which offers us one feasible way (incorporation of Ln-centered ligands into crystal structure) to design new promising IR NLO materials.

   Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, including oxides, chalcogenides, and halides, were identified as critical devices in the laser frequency conversion technique. (1-22) In recent years, in order to explore new NLO crystals with exceptional performances, many design strategies were found to promote the important physicochemical properties by the incorporation of suitable cations or/and anionic units into crystal structures. (23-26) Note that various combination formats (such as edge-sharing vs corner-sharing) of different anionic groups can offer a great effect on material performances, for example, Pb2Ba3(BO3)3Cl exhibits a large NLO response six times that of isostructural Ba5(BO3)3Cl since close Pb-BO3 ring in Pb2Ba3(BO3)3Cl makes the metal-oxygen bonds more polarizable than those of open Pb-B-O ring configuration; thus, regulating the link modes of functional ligands has become one key point to optimize the NLO performances. (27) As for the infrared (IR) region, commercial NLO materials still exhibit some performance drawbacks to satisfy the increasing application demand. (28-30) Nowadays, many rare-earth (Ln)-based sulfides display excellent NLO performances, but the specific contribution of LaSn ligands for NLO effect has not been clearly determined. (31-37) Moreover, the relationship between link modes (LaSn ligands and other typical "NLO active units") and NLO response was less studied so far. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a series of polar Ln3LiMS7 (Ln = La, Nd, Pr, Ho, Er; M = Ge, Sn) family (8 compounds) to study the above problem. Among them, La3LiMS7 (M = Ge, Sn) possess optimal performances: strong NLO responses with phase-matching behavior (0.7 vs 1.2 × benchmark AgGaS2) and high laser damage thresholds (LDTs: 6.0 vs 2.5 × AgGaS2), respectively. Note that different combination formats (open and close La3GeS4 rings) between LaS8 and MS4 ligands are discovered in their structures. Detailed theoretical calculations also illustrate that LaS8 ligands produce the major contribution for the NLO origin, and special unilateral-chelated configuration (close La3GeS4 rings) induced more delocalized d-p-π electrons and can improve the NLO performances.

  <p>
   Series of Ln3LiMS7 compounds are isostructural and crystallize in the polar P63 space group (Table S1). Herein, La3LiGeS7 is chosen as a representative to discuss their structural features (Figure 1). Seen from its structure, Li atoms are coordinated with six S atoms to form the unusual LiS6 octahedra that further link together by sharing faces to form the one-dimensional chains (Figure 1a,b). In general, Li atoms have three coordination environments with S atoms: LiSn (n = 4, 5, 6) and LiS4 is the most common ligand. Besides, LiS5 polyhedra exist in the structure of LiBaBS3 and these LiS5 units link together by sharing corners and edges to form the 2D layer. (38) Note that face-sharing (LiS6)n chains are rarely discovered in the structures of quaternary sulfides after the detailed survey in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), and this special structural type only exists in the structures of the above Ln3LiMS7 family. Furthermore, La atoms connect with eight S atoms to compose the LaS8 dodecahedra that further link together to form the 3D tunnels, where (LiS6)n chains are located within the tunnels (Figure 1c,d). Because of the Li atoms existing in the tunnels, the La3LiGeS7 crystal is relatively stable in the air without harmful moisture absorption. Besides, in the Ln3-M′-MIV-Q7 research system, all of them crystallize in the P63 space group and M′ sites can be occupied by the various atoms with different valence states, such as monovalent MI (Ag, Na, Cu, Li) with site occupancy (100%), divalent MII (Mg, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd) with occupancy (50%), trivalent MIII (Al, In, Ga, Sb) with occupancy (33.3%), and tetravalent MIV (Ge, Sn) with occupancy (25%); MIV sites are typical tetravalent cations (Si, Ge, Sn); Q sites are the chalcogen (S, Se). (39-42) Besides, cations in three sites have different coordination numbers in the Ln3-M′-M-Q7 system, such as LnQ8 (dodecahedron), M′Q6 (octahedron), and MQ4 (tetrahedron). As for title compounds, their tunnel sizes still have a positive correlation relation with an ionic radii of Ln and they show the obvious decreasing trend (from 5.3157 to 5.1398 Å) with the "lanthanide contraction" phenomenon (Figure 1e, Table S2). Besides, their tunnel sizes also show an increasing tend along with the substitution of M4+ ions (Ge to Sn). So, this study may give us a piece of instructional advice to predict the tunnel sizes and suitable M′ atoms for the polar Ln3-M′-M-Q7 research system.

   Optical performances of title compounds were systematically measured with the grinding microcrystals after repeated spontaneous crystallization (Figures 2, S2, and S3). Note that their experimental powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns agree well with the corresponding theoretical ones, respectively (Figure S1). Besides, the investigated result shows that their experimental optical band gaps (Eg) are 3.02 and 2.40 eV for La3LiGeS7 and La3LiSnS7, respectively (Figure 2a,b). Raman spectra show that they exhibit no obvious absorption peaks in the range from 500 to 4000 cm-1. Raman peaks as the vibration of M-S bonds are different in the La3LiGeS7 (265, 368, 390, and 436 cm-1) and La3LiSnS7 (347, 370, and 388 cm-1), respectively. Their M-S peak positions can be changed by the different MIV metals and show an obvious shift to high absorption energies from La3LiSnS7 (388 cm-1) to La3LiGeS7 (436 cm-1), which are similar to those of other analogues, such as Li2HgMIVS4 (43) and Na2Hg3MIV2S8. (44) Other Raman peaks are attributed as the La-S and Li-S bonds, such as La3LiGeS7 (120, 160, 210 cm-1) and La3LiSnS7 (150, 166, 189 cm-1). Besides, other title compounds show similar Raman patterns compared with those of La3LiMS7, which indicates that different lanthanides have no obvious effect on the shift of Raman peaks in the Ln3-M′-M-Q7 system (Figures 2c,d and S3). Besides, their second-order NLO intensity versus different particle sizes under 2090 nm laser radiation was also investigated. Among them, requisite phase-matching behavior and considerable NLO responses (0.7 and 1.2 times that of benchmark AgGaS2 at 200-250 nm) were discovered in La3LiGeS7 and La3LiSnS7 (Figure 2e), respectively, which are comparable to those of previously reported Ln3-M′-M-Q7 analogues, such as Y3Zn0.5SiS7 (2.0 × KTiOPO4@2.05 μm), (45) La3Sb0.33SiS7 (0.5 × AgGaS2@2.05 μm), (46) La3InGe0.5S7 (1.8 × AgGaS2@2.05 μm). (39) Except La3LiMS7, other title compounds exhibit the weak signals that may be affected by their absorption peaks, poor crystallinity, or/and dark crystal color. For example, seen from the absorption spectra of Pr3LiGeS7 and Pr3LiSnS7 (Figure S2), they exhibit the obvious optical absorption range from 1000 to 1100 nm spectral region, which seriously affected their second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. The similar phenomenon was also found in other known Ln-based compounds with nondetectable SHG signals, such as Pr4GaSbS9 and Nd4GaSbS9. (31) Thus, long-wavelength lasers are required to achieve the possible NLO test for title compounds. Laser damage resistance is another critical parameter for the NLO material and the LDTs of La3LiGeS7 and La3LiSnS7 were measured to be 6.0 and 2.5 times that of AgGaS2, respectively, which indicates that both of them have potential application prospect under high-power laser radiation (Table S3). Particularly, La3LiGeS7 exhibits excellent balanced performances, such as wide optical band gap (3.02 eV), high LDT (6.0 × AgGaS2), good NLO effect (0.7 × AgGaS2) with phase-matching behavior, indicating that it can effectively avoid the existing performance drawbacks in famous IR NLO materials.

   Inherent structure-property relationship in title compounds was also investigated through the first-principle calculation, and La3LiMS7 (M = Ge, Sn) was chosen as the representatives to be discussed. Both of them are indirect compounds and their theoretical band gaps are 2.74 eV for La3LiGeS7 and 2.53 eV for La3LiSnS7 based on the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) method, (47) respectively (Table S4). Noted that in the DOS map, strong hybridizations occur among the La 5d and S 3p states in the wide range of -4 to -0.5 eV, while Ge/Sn-S hybrid area is deeper. Moreover, the bottom of the conduction band is predominated by La 5d with a few of Ge 4s4p or Sn 5s5p states and negligible Li 2s states, implying strong d-p interactions in La-S bonds for La3LiMS7 (Figure S4). Under 2090 nm fundamental light, NLO coefficients (d15) were calculated to be -7.02 pm/V for La3LiGeS7 and -11.07 pm/V for La3LiSnS7, respectively, which are also in accordance with experimental values (Figure 2f, Table S5). By means of qualitative SHG-density and quantitative real-space atom-cutting methods, (48,49) their NLO effects originate from the synergistic effect between tetrahedral MS4 and distorted LaS8 groups (Figures S5 and S6). As for the d15 coefficient, the LaS8 ligand offers more contribution than that of the MS4 ligand in both of La3LiMS7 (Table S5). The SHG-density method also reveals that obvious overlapping and intensity are located between La-S bonds, therefore, more contribution to the SHG response. Dipole moments calculation indicates that LaS8 groups superposed along the c axis with small deviatory angles make the La3LiMS7 have a natural anisotropic c axis with large net dipole, which are considered as favorable geo-structure of generating SHG response (Figures S7 and S8).

   Moreover, seen from their structures, they exhibit two special link modes (open or close La3GeS4 ring) between LaS8 and MS4 ligands, which shows a unique unilateral chelated configuration (strong d-p hybridization) emerged in the close ring, whereas only σ-bonding exists in the open-ring (Figure 3). Further analysis indicates that the La-S-Ge close ring shows a prominent degree of delocalization (E(2) = 120.0 kcal/mol), much higher than that of La3GeS4 open ring (E(2) = 17.5 kcal/mol), according to the calculated second-order perturbation energies (Table S9). This shows that the unique unilateral-chelated (close La3GeS4 ring) configuration possesses more delocalized π electrons, hence more anticipated susceptibility. In open-ring La3GeS4, on the contrary, only σ-bonding exists among La-S, wherein interactions reduce considerably (Figure S9). Therefore, the close La3GeS4 ring possesses more delocalized electrons owing to its d-p-π interactions compared with that of the La-S-Ge open ring, which can enhance the susceptible dipole oscillation and further improve the NLO performance. Similarly, bonding electron density difference (Δρ) and polarizability anisotropy (δ) also indicate that LaS8 ligands offer major contributions to optical anisotropy since their various bond lengths induce the charge transfer disparity (Figure S11 and Table S8). Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) is a useful tool for the analysis concerning the bonding and antibonding character of the electrons. (50) COHP calculations show that the integrated -COHP value (-ICOHP) of La-S2(close) is larger than those of La-S3(open) bonds, even larger than the shortest La-S bond, which implies strong interactions in La-S2(close) (Tables S6 and S7). Respective SHG contribution on La-S-Ge close and open rings in the La3LiGeS7 was further calculated, and the result shows that the La-S-Ge close ring produces the 91.1% contribution to the SHG tensor and La-S-Ge open ring gives the negative effect (-46.4%) on the SHG tensor. Therefore, close La3GeS4 rings possess more delocalized electrons owing to its d-p-π interactions compared with that of La-S-Ge open rings, which further enhances electron susceptibility under the external electric field (Figure 4). Comparison of critical performances among La3LiMS7 and AgGaS2 is shown in Table 1. Based on the above analysis, the research result in this work illustrates that the incorporation of La-centered ligands into the crystal structure can produce improved NLO performance and unique unilateral-chelated configuration induced delocalized d-p-π electrons are beneficial for SHG response.

   In summary, series of compounds in the new polar Ln3LiMS7 family have been synthesized for the first time and La3LiMS7 have been verified as promising IR NLO materials. Among them, La3LiMS7 exhibit superior performances and satisfy a suitable balance between the strong NLO effect and high LDT. The theoretical calculation indicates that their NLO origin is caused by the mixed contribution of LnS8 and MS4 ligands, and the quantified NLO contribution of LnS8 is more than that of the MS4 ligand. More importantly, one feasible way was proposed (incorporation of Ln-centered ligands into crystal structure) to design new future IR NLO materials in this work and this research result further verifies that unique unilateral-chelated mode (close La3MS4 ring)-induced delocalized d-p-π electrons exert a huge influence on the enhancement of the NLO effect.

   Experimental Section
  </h2>
  <p>
   Microcrystals of title compounds were synthesized in vacuum-sealed silica tubes with different reaction temperatures (thiogermanates: 900 vs thiostannates: 800 °C). Single-crystal XRD data were collected by a Bruker D8 VENTURE diffractometer. Powder XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D2 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Diffuse-reflectance spectra were measured within the range from 200 to 1100 nm by a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700DUV spectrophotometer. Raman spectra were investigated by a LABRAM HR Evolution spectrometer under 532 nm laser radiation. Powder SHG responses of title compounds and AgGaS2 were measured by a Q-switch pulse laser under different particle sizes. LDTs of title compounds were evaluated on a microcrystal sample by a pulsed YAG laser (1.06 μm). COHP calculation was computed using the LMTO package. Dipole moment, SHG-density, and structure-performance relationship were also studied by the density functional theory method (details in the Supporting Information).
