Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3\u22c56H2O, In(NO3)3\u22c54.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3\u22c56H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fh in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-\u03b4 (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fh in air.",

The effect of controlling the flux parameters (reactant to flux molar ratio, temperature, and time) on the hydrogen evolution photocatalytic activity of SnNb2O6 was investigated as a means to control the surface properties. They started from SnO and Nb2O5 with excess SnCl2, and the molar ratio of reactant to flux was varied between 1:1 and 1:14. The crystal morphology was tuned by increasing the flux to reactant molar ratio, affording well-defined particles with non-aggregated surfaces. The XRD patterns and SEM analyses confirmed a 2D anisotropic growth along the (bc) plane, providing a plate-like morphology as the flux ratio increased. Fig. 6 shows SEM images of SnNb2O6 synthesized by the molten salt flux-assisted method and by solid-state synthesis.",

A solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was used to control the pH at 6. At a pH of 6 and a temperature of 60 \u00b0C, citric acid was added to the solution. The mole ratio of metal ions to EDTA and citric acid was 1:1:1.5. The mixed solution was then heated to 90 \u00b0C while stirring until a brown gel was formed. The gel was dried overnight in an oven at 150 \u00b0C, followed by grinding the formed precursors. The ground powder was calcined in air at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h to allow the cubic perovskite phase to form. The NiO\u2013YSZ was synthesized using a conventional solid-state method, for which the details are presented in our previous publication.",
