The alloy with hierarchical microstructure exhibits a notable strengthening behavior, displaying a YS (σ YS) of ~1056 MPa, an UTS (σ UTS) of ~1526 MPa and a total El of ~15.6%, suggesting that the alloy achieves an outstanding combination of strength and ductility in the as-cast state. The strain hardening rate (SHR) (Θ) during tensile deformation is a key factor contributing to the excellent mechanical properties of the alloy. Fig. 6(b) illustrates the SHR (Θ = ∂σ/∂ε) of this alloy. The Θ during tensile deformation shows a two-stage behavior, lacking the final sharp decrease stage seen in other HEAs and traditional alloys [24-27]. Specifically, the Θ first rapidly decreases from an ultra-high level to ~4565 MPa (ε less than 0.035) and then steadily decreases with increasing strain within the range of 0.035 to 0.138. This two-stage behavior indicates that the alloy undergoes a dynamic recovery process of dislocations during the initial deformation stage, followed by the severe hindrance of dislocation movement caused by the high-density phase interface, which significantly delays the fracture of the alloy. In Fig. 6(c, d), it can be observed that our Fe27Ni35Cr18.25Al13.75Co2Ti2Mo2 alloy demonstrates a high YS and high UTS, as well as appreciable ductility when compared to other HEAs [19,23,28-32] (the values of tensile properties of some HEAs are given in Table 3 ).

      "Fig. 1 presents XRD pattern and EBSD maps of the as-cast Fe27Ni35Cr18.25Al13.75Co2Ti2Mo2 HEA. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1(a) shows that this alloy has a multi-phase structure, primarily composed of disordered BCC phase (A2) and disordered FCC phase. Moreover, a discernible peak attributed to (100) lattice plane manifests at approximately 2θ ≈ 31°, indicative of the characteristic peak of the ordered BCC structure (B2 phase). Such a phenomenon signifies the alloy's transition from disorder to order during solidification from a high-temperature liquid to a room-temperature microstructure. This result, in essence, provides an initial glimpse into the intricate nature of the microstructure. As the disordered BCC and ordered BCC structures possess identical crystal structures, distinguishing between them through the EBSD technique is unfeasible. Henceforth, in the subsequent text, the BCC phase designated via the EBSD technique encompasses both disordered BCC phase (A2 phase) and ordered BCC phase (B2 phase). Fig. 1(b) displays the inverse pole figure (IPF) of the as-cast alloy, illustrating the grain structure. Small equiaxed grains, with an average size of approximately 45 μm, are discernible with faint visibility. Meanwhile, Fig. 1(c) shows the phase distribution map of the alloy. Since A2 and B2 phases possess identical crystallographic structures, we only observe the BCC phase and disordered FCC phase, and the contents of the two phases are ~49.9 vol.% and ~50.1 vol.%, respectively. Fig. 1(d, e) displays microstructure of the alloy at a higher magnification. The band contrast micrograph in Fig. 1(d) shows that the as-cast Fe27Ni35Cr18.25Al13.75Co2Ti2Mo2 has a hierarchical microstructure similar to Widmanstätten and micro-platelet morphology, and the irregular arrangement between BCC phase and disordered FCC phase is different from that in eutectic HEAs (EHEA). IPF maps of BCC phase and FCC phase corresponding to Fig. 1(d) are displayed in Fig. 1(e, f). The mapping region encompasses two prominent grains separated by a thin FCC film that exhibits characteristics resembling the grain boundary. It is noteworthy that the BCC phase exhibits a consistent orientation within each grain, while the FCC phase exhibits multiple variant orientations.\n",

      "SEM-BSE images of the as-cast HEA are shown in Fig. 2 . According to the contrast of different atomic numbers and EDS in SEM (Table 1 ), the light gray areas represent the (Fe, Cr, Ni)-rich FCC phase, and the dark areas correspond to (Al, Ni)-rich BCC phase. As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the grains are conspicuously demarcated by thin FCC films. The FCC phase exhibits different morphologies within different grains, with blocky FCC phases resembling rhombuses and vermicular-like strip FCC phases. Under as-cast conditions, the width of FCC phase attains a diminutive size. Accordingly, based on morphology of the FCC phase, the microstructures are designated ultrafine rhombus microstructure (URM) and ultrafine vermicular microstructure (UVM). Fig. 2(b) presents distinct morphologies of FCC phase within the same BCC grain, exhibiting a hierarchical nature with respect to length and thickness. Fig. 2(c) depicts a high-magnification image of the URM region. Rhombic FCC is arranged in a specific direction within the BCC grain, giving rise to distinct strip areas. Moreover, the BCC phase interposed between these strip areas shows different morphologies of decomposition phases, including spherical precipitations and maze-typed structures produced by SP. This observation is consistent with the XRD results, confirming that the BCC phase undergoes an ordered phase transition process during cooling. In Fig. 2(d), it is evident that the FCC phase in the upper grain exhibits an UVM, whereas the FCC phase in the bottom grain displays an ultrafine lamellar microstructure (ULM) alternating with the BCC phase. Additionally, there are numerous traces of ordered BCC between the lamellar FCC phases. Based on these preliminary observations, the as-cast Fe27Ni35Cr18.25Al13.75Co2Ti2Mo2 alloy possesses a hierarchical solidification microstructure on the micron scale.\n",

After melting, they were cooled in a water-cooled copper mold and flipped and re-melted five times to improve compositional homogeneity. Subsequently, the ingots were cold-rolled to a 30% reduction in thickness and homogenized at 1100 °C for 24 h. Then, the homogenized plate of the Co60Ni40 alloy and the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were further cold-rolled to a 92% reduction in thickness and annealed at 750 °C for 120 s and 850 °C for 3.6 ks, respectively.
