Both of these two isostructural compounds had layered [B5O7F3]\u221e structures with large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses ranging from 2.3 to 2.5 \u00d7 KH2PO4 (KDP) and short UV absorption edges (<200 nm). The first-principles calculation demonstrated that their nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were superior to those of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF). In contrast to the alkali fluorooxoborates, these two fluorooxoborates showed not only remarkable stability against air and moisture but also high thermal stability. Therefore, M2B10O14F6 (M = Ca, Sr) should be promising deep-ultraviolet (DUV) NLO materials."}

Here, we describe a new strategy to search for such materials based on rational selection of fundamental structural units. By combining asymmetric AlO3F tetrahedra and \u03c0-conjugated B3O6 rings, a new aluminum borate fluoride, CsAlB3O6F was obtained. It exhibits excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties including a high optical transmittance with a cut-off edge shorter than 190 nm, large second harmonic generation intensities (2.0\u00d7 KH2PO4, KDP), and suitable birefringence for phase-matching under 200 nm. It also has good thermal stability and can be synthesized easily in an open system."}

It is well known that borates are the most ideal material class for the design of new DUV NLO crystals owing to the presence of good NLO genes,e.g., BO3or B3O6groups. However, the NLOpyro-borates with the B2O5dimers as the sole basic building units are still rarely reported owing to their small SHG responses. In this communication, by constructing a planar pentagonal [Ca(B2O5)]\u221elayer, the NLOpyro-borate Ba4Ca(B2O5)2F2with a large SHG response (\u223c2.2 \u00d7 KDP, or \u223c7 \u00d7 \u03b1-Li4B2O5) and a DUV transparent window has been designed and synthesized. The first-principles calculations show that the large SHG response of Ba4Ca(B2O5)2F2mainly originates from the better \u03c0-conjugation of the coplanar B2O5dimers in the [Ca(B2O5)]\u221elayer. In addition, the planar pentagonal pattern in the [Ca(B2O5)]\u221elayer provides an ideal template for designing the new DUV NLO crystals, apart from those in known DUV borates,e.g., the [Be2BO3F2]\u221elayer in KBe2BO3F2(KBBF)."}
{"title": "Designing a Beryllium-Free Deep-Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material without a Structural Instability Problem", "abstract": "\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society.A beryllium-free deep-ultraviolet (deep-UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) material K3Ba3Li2Al4B6O20F is developed mainly by the element substitution of Be for Al and Li from Sr2Be2B2O7 that was considered as one of the most promising deep-UV NLO materials. K3Ba3Li2Al4B6O20F preserves the structural merits of Sr2Be2B2O7 and thus exhibits no layering growth tendency and possesses the optical properties required for deep-UV NLO applications, including deep-UV transparency, phase-matchability, and sufficiently large second-harmonic generation (1.5 \u00d7 KH2PO4). Furthermore, it overcomes the structural instability problem of Sr2Be2B2O7, which is confirmed by the obtainment of large single crystals and phonon dispersion calculations. These attributes make it very attractive for next-generation deep-UV NLO materials. The substitution of Be for Al and Li in beryllium borates provides a new opportunity to design beryllium-free deep-UV NLO materials with good performance."}
{"title": "A short-wave UV nonlinear optical sulfate of high thermal stability", "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 Fujian Institute of Research of the Structure of Matter. All rights reserved.Compared with borates, carbonates, nitrates and phosphates, sulfates have been ignored as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for a long time. Recently, researchers started to realize sulfates which have the potential as NLO materials, and synthesized some sulfate NLO materials by the water solution method and solvothermal method. However, all these sulfate NLO materials have the same problem of low thermal stability. Here, we synthesized a new Cs4Mg6(SO4)8, which crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a = 9.102, b = 9.955, c = 16.127 \u00c5, V = 1461.3 \u00c53, Z = 2, F(000) = 1352, \u03bc = 5.777 mm-1, R = 0.0213 and wR = 0.0480. The single crystal structure can be described as a three-dimensional framework constructed by MgO6 octahedra and SO4 tetrahedra. Relevant optical measurements indicate that Cs4Mg6(SO4)8 is short-wave ultraviolet transparent and has a moderate second harmonic generation response. Theoretical calculations by the CASTEP package reveal that S-O groups are NLO-active anionic groups. Significantly, Cs4Mg6(SO4)8 has high thermal stability up to 781 \u00b0C based on thermal analyses. We believe that our work will provide a new strategy for researchers to develop new sulfate short-wave ultraviolet NLO materials of high thermal stability."}

Na3Zn2(CO3)3F crystallizes in the space group C2/c with a sandwich-like framework in which the stacked [Zn(CO3)]\u221e layers are connected with one another by bridging F atoms and [CO3] groups alternately. Interestingly, each Zn atom is surrounded by one F atom and four O atoms, forming a distorted [ZnO4F] trigonal bipyramid, which is observed for the first time in the carbonate system. Na3Zn2(CO3)3F has high transparency in a wide spectral region ranging from UV to mid IR with a short ultraviolet absorption edge (\u223c213 nm). First-principles calculations revealed that Na3Zn2(CO3)3F possesses a large birefringence (\u0394n = 0.11, \u03bb = 589 nm), which is mainly contributed by the coplanar arrangement of [CO3] groups in the ab plane.
