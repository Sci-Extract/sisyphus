Among them, requisite phase-matching behavior and considerable NLO responses (0.7 and 1.2 times that of benchmark AgGaS2 at 200-250 nm) were discovered in La3LiGeS7 and La3LiSnS7 (Figure 2e), respectively, which are comparable to those of previously reported Ln3-M′-M-Q7 analogues, such as Y3Zn0.5SiS7 (2.0 × KTiOPO4@2.05 μm), (45) La3Sb0.33SiS7 (0.5 × AgGaS2@2.05 μm), (46) La3InGe0.5S7 (1.8 × AgGaS2@2.05 μm). (39) Except La3LiMS7, other title compounds exhibit the weak signals that may be affected by their absorption peaks, poor crystallinity, or/and dark crystal color. For example, seen from the absorption spectra of Pr3LiGeS7 and Pr3LiSnS7 (Figure S2), they exhibit the obvious optical absorption range from 1000 to 1100 nm spectral region, which seriously affected their second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. The similar phenomenon was also found in other known Ln-based compounds with nondetectable SHG signals, such as Pr4GaSbS9 and Nd4GaSbS9. (31) Thus, long-wavelength lasers are required to achieve the possible NLO test for title compounds. Laser damage resistance is another critical parameter for the NLO material and the LDTs of La3LiGeS7 and La3LiSnS7 were measured to be 6.0 and 2.5 times that of AgGaS2, respectively, which indicates that both of them have potential application prospect under high-power laser radiation (Table S3). Particularly, La3LiGeS7 exhibits excellent balanced performances, such as wide optical band gap (3.02 eV), high LDT (6.0 × AgGaS2), good NLO effect (0.7 × AgGaS2) with phase-matching behavior, indicating that it can effectively avoid the existing performance drawbacks in famous IR NLO materials.', metadata={'section': 'abstract', 'source': 'test.html', 'title': 'Unique Unilateral-Chelated Mode-Induced d–p−π Interaction Enhances Second-Harmonic Generation Response in New Ln3LiMS7 Family'}), info=[ExtractSHG(nlo_name='La3LiGeS7', shg=0.7, shg_unit='AgGaS2'), ExtractSHG(nlo_name='La3LiSnS7', shg=1.2, shg_unit='AgGaS2'), ExtractSHG(nlo_name='Y3Zn0.5SiS7', shg=2.0, shg_unit='KTiOPO4'), ExtractSHG(nlo_name='La3Sb0.33SiS7', shg=0.5, shg_unit='AgGaS2'), ExtractSHG(nlo_name='La3InGe0.5S7', shg=1.8, shg_unit='AgGaS2')]),\n",
