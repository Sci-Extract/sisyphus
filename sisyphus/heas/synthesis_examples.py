detect_para_1 = """Ingots of 20 g with nominal compositions of CoCrFeNiNbx (x = 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.65) were prepared by co-melting high purity elements (99.9 wt%) under argon atmosphere in an arc-melter. These arc-melted ingots (AMI) were remelted several times and were reversed each time before melting in order to obtain chemical homogeneity. Finally, button shape ingot of 30 mm diameter and 12 mm thick, was solidified in the water cooled Cu-hearth of the arc-melter. The density of the alloys was measured using semi-micro balance following the Archimedes principle."""
detect_para_2 = """The HEA with a nominal composition of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) was fabricated using vacuum induction melting furnace using pure elements of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (purity >99.9%). The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm)."""
