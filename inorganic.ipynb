White precipitate appeared immediately and was stirred for 5 h to complete the precipitation reaction.

      "In recent research, the optical absorption and photocatalytic activities of metal oxides have been investigated with the use of a low-temperature AgNO3 flux to yield silver-exchanged metal oxides. Silver-exchange reactions of the layered RbLaNb2O7, RbA2Nb3O10 (A = Ca, Sr), and Rb2La2Ti3O10 perovskite structures were found to yield the AgLaNb2O7, AgA2Nb3O10 and Ag2La2Ti3O10 phases that exhibited a pronounced red-shift in the optical absorption edge by ~0.5 to ~1.0 eV. After the silver-exchange reactions, the particles were shown to maintain their original morphologies and sizes, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 7 for RbLaNb2O7 and AgLaNb2O7. Electronic structure calculations confirmed the formation of a new higher-energy valence band comprised primarily of the Ag 4d10 orbitals in each of these layered structures. All silver-exchanged products exhibited significant increases in their photocatalytic rates for hydrogen production. The silver-exchanged RbA2Nb3O10 structures, i.e.. AgA2Nb3O10, exhibited the largest increase in the photocatalytic rates for hydrogen production in aqueous methanol under ultraviolet and visible irradiation ( ~ 13616 μmol H2 g-1 h-1) compared to before silver-exchange ( ~ 1418 μmol H2 g-1 h-1). The photocatalytic rates were also found to increase exponentially over time as the Ag(I) cations were reduced on the surfaces and interlayer spacings as Ag(s) nanoislands that function as cocatalysts.\n",

      "Ternary tantalates and niobates of the Am+(n+1)/mB3n+1O(8n+3) (Am+ = Na(I), Ag(I), Cu(I), Pb(II); B = Nb, Ta) structural family can be prepared by exchange of the A-site cations using a molten flux. For example, the hexagonal lead-tantalate phases Pb1.5Ta7O19 and PbTa4O11 were discovered by flux-mediated lead-exchange reactions starting from the Cu3Ta7O19 and A2Ta4O11 (A = Na, Ag) parent structures and a PbCl2 flux at 800 °C and 700 °C, respectively. These lead tantalate phases could only be achieved by lead-exchange reactions using a PbCl2 flux in vacuum sealed fused-silica tubes. Solid-state syntheses and lead-exchange reactions of A2Ta4O11 (A = Na, Ag) using PbCl2 in air instead yielded the PbTa2O6 and Pb3Ta4O13 phases, respectively. Lead-exchange reactions under vacuum and in air yielded rod- and octahedron-shaped morphologies for PbTa4O11 and Pb3Ta4O13 phases, respectively. The fast growth of Am+2/mTa4O11 along the c axis results in rod-shaped particles, as shown in Fig. 10. The PbTa4O11 phase exhibits a bandgap size of ~3.8 eV, which is ~0.5 eV smaller in energy than that found for Na2Ta4O11 at ~4.3 eV. A reduction in the band gap was also observed with an increase in the Pb(II) content as a result of the flux exchange, and which served to increase the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen and oxygen production. The PbTa4O11 phase was reported with a photocatalytic activity of ~175 μmol H2 g-1 h-1 in aqueous methanol under ultraviolet and visible irradiation, while the solid-state prepared precursor Ag2Ta4O11 had a rate of ~23 μmol H2 g-1 h-1. The PbTa4O11 phase generated ~181 μmol O2 g-1 h-1 in aqueous silver nitrate under ultraviolet and visible irradiation, while its precursor Ag2Ta4O11 exhibited a similar rate of ~165 μmol O2 g-1 h-1. Higher activity for water reduction was found for layered tantalate structures comprised of TaO7 pentagonal bipyramid layers, which can serve as extended charge-migration pathways.\n",

      "The synthesis of metastable metal-oxides in high purity is challenging using conventional solid-state synthesis techniques. Metastable phases are formed due to the stabilization of a higher-energy phase when the chemical system cannot reach equilibrium at the timescale afforded by the reaction conditions. A finite energy barrier for the diffusion of ions can hinder the transformation of the system from a higher-energy phase into a more energetically stable phase. At high temperatures there is a higher probability of transforming into the most stable phase, and so there is a characteristic \"lifetime\" for a metastable phase. Compositional, structural, and morphological metastable phases form under non-equilibrium and kinetically-controlled pathways. An optimal temperature range where nucleation rates are at their maximum for metastable phases exists and can be extended by modifying the crystal growth rate. The rate of crystal growth is a function of the concentration and viscosity of the solution, which is dependent on the flux used. A critical size during nucleation must be achieved in order to facilitate the growth of metastable phases, which can occur if isolated during its finite lifetime. Use of a molten salt as a flux for the synthesis of metal oxides increases the temperature range and lifetime of the metastable phase, facilitating rapid crystal growth.\n",

      "Several Cu(I)-containing mixed-metal oxides are reported to exist in the Cu2O-M2O5 (M = Nb, Ta) system that cannot be synthesized using conventional solid-state methods. For example, the synthesis of Cu2Nb8O21, a metastable p-type semiconductor, was prepared in high purity by the reaction of Cu2O and Nb2O5 nanoparticles within a CuCl flux using a 10:1 flux-to-reactant molar ratio. The CuCl flux solvent was preferentially utilized in these reactions owing to its low melting point, ability to solubilize Cu2O, and the common Cu(I) cations as that of the Cu2O reagent. The reaction mixture was heated in an evacuated fused-silica ampoule at 550 °C for 24 h that was immediately quenched. The Cu2Nb8O21 phase does not form in the absence of a molten flux at lower temperatures of 550 °C. At a higher reaction temperature of 650 °C the Cu2Nb8O21 compound begins to transform into CuNb3O8, and after the temperature reaches 750 °C, the Cu2Nb8O21 compound has completely transformed into CuNb3O8. In the Cu2O-Ta2O5 system, the Cu2Ta4O11 and Cu7Ta15O41 phases have not been reported to have been synthesized in high purity, but instead have been found as side products at reaction temperatures ranging from 700 °C to 1000 °C. Both the Cu2Ta4O11 and Cu7Ta15O41 phases have been calculated to have 33% and 22% vacancies on the copper-site positions within the unit cell, respectively. The Cu2Ta4O11 phase has been reported to be stabilized through doping with zirconium and by utilizing solid solutions such as Cu2-xNaxTa4O11. These Cu(I)-containing mixed-metal oxides exhibit band gaps deep within the visible-light energy range, spanning from ~1.3 eV to ~2.6 eV, and have shown high cathodic photocurrents for water reduction under visible-light in the form of polycrystalline photoelectrodes. Thus, the preparation of new Cu(I)-oxides in high purity can be facilitated with the use of a flux-mediated synthetic route in combination with binary-oxide nanoparticle precursors.\n",

      "The text describes the synthesis of several Cu(I)-containing mixed-metal oxides using a flux-mediated method. Specifically, it mentions the synthesis of Cu2Nb8O21 from Cu2O and Nb2O5 nanoparticles in a CuCl flux. This reaction is classified as a flux reaction due to the use of CuCl as a flux to facilitate the reaction. The text also describes the transformation of Cu2Nb8O21 into CuNb3O8 at higher temperatures, but this is more of a phase transformation rather than a separate synthesis reaction. Additionally, the text mentions the Cu2Ta4O11 and Cu7Ta15O41 phases, but it does not provide specific precursor details or reaction conditions for their synthesis, only that they are found as side products. Therefore, the primary reaction extracted is the synthesis of Cu2Nb8O21.\n",

The crystalline rare-earth orthoferrites LnFeO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) have been synthesized by flux methods at a temperature of 400 °C using a molten hydroxide in a 10:1 flux-to-reactant molar ratio. The syntheses of the LnFeO3 phases were attempted by means of a eutectic NaOH-KOH flux with a heating temperature of 300-500 °C and a reaction time of 6-24 h. The hydroxide eutectic flux has a reduced melting point and increased oxobasicity from incorporating KOH. These reaction conditions did not yield a phase-pure product; therefore, the syntheses were attempted via a pure NaOH or KOH flux. Phase-pure LnFeO3 products were formed using a NaOH flux, but the metastable phases were not observed when using only a more basic molten KOH flux. The flux preparation using a NaOH flux yielded crystals with sizes of 5-10 μm and a cube morphology indicative of growth along the {100}, as shown in Fig. 11.\n",

      "abstract: AbstractMolten-salt reactions can be used to prepare single-crystal metal-oxide particles with morphologies and sizes that can be varied from the nanoscale to the microscale, subsequently enabling a growing number of novel investigations into their photocatalytic activities. Crystal growth using flux-mediated methods facilitates finer synthetic manipulation over particle characteristics. The synthetic flexibility that flux synthesis affords for the growth of metal-oxides has led to the stabilization of phases with limited stability, the discovery of new compositions, and access to alternate crystal morphologies and sizes that exhibit significant changes in photocatalytic activities at their surfaces, such as for the reduction of water to hydrogen in aqueous solutions. This approach has significantly impacted the current understanding of the optical and photocatalytic properties of metal-oxides, such as the dependence of band gap energies on the structure and chemical composition (i.e.. obtained from flux-mediated ion-exchange reactions). Thus, flux preparations of metal-oxide photocatalysts assist in the growth and optimization of their particles in order to understand and tune the photocatalytic reaction rates at their surfaces.\n",

      "paragraph: Ternary tantalates and niobates of the Am+(n+1)/mB3n+1O(8n+3) (Am+ = Na(I), Ag(I), Cu(I), Pb(II); B = Nb, Ta) structural family can be prepared by exchange of the A-site cations using a molten flux. For example, the hexagonal lead-tantalate phases Pb1.5Ta7O19 and PbTa4O11 were discovered by flux-mediated lead-exchange reactions starting from the Cu3Ta7O19 and A2Ta4O11 (A = Na, Ag) parent structures and a PbCl2 flux at 800 °C and 700 °C, respectively. These lead tantalate phases could only be achieved by lead-exchange reactions using a PbCl2 flux in vacuum sealed fused-silica tubes. Solid-state syntheses and lead-exchange reactions of A2Ta4O11 (A = Na, Ag) using PbCl2 in air instead yielded the PbTa2O6 and Pb3Ta4O13 phases, respectively. Lead-exchange reactions under vacuum and in air yielded rod- and octahedron-shaped morphologies for PbTa4O11 and Pb3Ta4O13 phases, respectively. The fast growth of Am+2/mTa4O11 along the c axis results in rod-shaped particles, as shown in Fig. 10. The PbTa4O11 phase exhibits a bandgap size of ~3.8 eV, which is ~0.5 eV smaller in energy than that found for Na2Ta4O11 at ~4.3 eV. A reduction in the band gap was also observed with an increase in the Pb(II) content as a result of the flux exchange, and which served to increase the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen and oxygen production. The PbTa4O11 phase was reported with a photocatalytic activity of ~175 μmol H2 g-1 h-1 in aqueous methanol under ultraviolet and visible irradiation, while the solid-state prepared precursor Ag2Ta4O11 had a rate of ~23 μmol H2 g-1 h-1. The PbTa4O11 phase generated ~181 μmol O2 g-1 h-1 in aqueous silver nitrate under ultraviolet and visible irradiation, while its precursor Ag2Ta4O11 exhibited a similar rate of ~165 μmol O2 g-1 h-1. Higher activity for water reduction was found for layered tantalate structures comprised of TaO7 pentagonal bipyramid layers, which can serve as extended charge-migration pathways.\n",
