SYN
The HEA with a nominal composition of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) was fabricated using vacuum induction melting furnace using pure elements of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (purity >99.9%). The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm).

Figure shows the XRD patterns of fine-grained (FG) and coarse-grained (CG) samples before HPT processing (N = 0) and after five turns of HPT processing (N = 5). The XRD patterns of the annealed sample show a single FCC phase with no secondary phases, which confirms the thermodynamic calculations reported earlier for this HEA. The XRD patterns of HPT-processed samples also show a single FCC phase, indicating no evidence of phase transformation after HPT. Also, HPT processing leads to a significant peak broadening of XRD patterns, indicating grain refinement and lattice strain.
Figure shows the bright-field (BF) TEM images of the FG sample after 1/4 turn (Figure a) and 1 turn (Figure b) of HPT processing. The BF TEM image of the FG sample after 1/4 turn shows a high density of tangled dislocations (Figure a). The fact that accumulation of dislocations can occur within the grains could be because of the planar dislocation-slip modes.. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of Figure a shows only FCC phase diffraction spots (taken along [011] zone axis), confirming the presence of a single phase. The microstructure of the FG sample after one turn of HPT (Figure b) shows significant grain refinement with an average size of ≈100 nm. Correspondingly, the SAED pattern of one turn shows the concentric FCC ring pattern, indicating nanograins with high-angle grain boundaries. The strain contrast observed in nanograins can be related to the accumulation of dislocations.

The engineering stress versus strain curves of the FG and CG samples before and after HPT processing at different turns (1/4, 1, and 5 turns) are shown in Figure . The tensile curves indicate that samples in annealed condition exhibit low yield strength (YS) and high elongation to failure, whereas the HPT processing led to an enhancement in YS accompanied by a reduction in the elongation to failure. The strength-ductility trade-off is in agreement with the classic mechanical response of ultra-fine grained (UFG) metallic materials processed by SPD techniques. Table summarizes the relative data for the engineering YS, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and total elongation to failure (δ) for both the FG and CG samples. The CG sample in annealed condition shows a YS of ≈230 MPa, and the FG sample shows a relatively higher YS of ≈430 MPa. The higher YS observed in the FG sample can be attributed to the Hall-Petch strengthening effect. The UTSs of the FG and CG samples are 751 and 532 MPa, respectively, and the CG sample presents slightly higher total elongation to failure in comparison with the FG sample (CG ≈58% and FG ≈48%).

Number of HPT turns [N]	Sample	YS [MPa]	UTS [MPa]	δ [%]
0	FG	430	720	48.1
CG	230	532	57.6
1/4	FG	1120	1447	15.9

CG	1660	1854	14.3
5	FG	1940	1986	6.0
CG	1950	2015	6.3
After 1/4 turn of HPT processing, the UTS increases significantly for both FG ( ≈ 1.4 GPa) and CG ( ≈ 1.5 GPa) samples. The strength increases further with increasing the number of turns, and the increase in strength is accompanied by a decrease in total elongation to failure. After five turns, the tensile strength of FG and CG samples reached similar values ( ≈ 2 GPa) with a total elongation to failure of ≈6%. The CG sample presents relatively higher YS and UTS as compared with the FG sample after 1/4 turn and 1 turn of HPT. This indicates that the strength enhancement in the CG sample is higher than that of the FG sample, considering the initial strength of the FG and CG samples (before HPT).

SYN
The CoCuFeMnNi alloy was obtained by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) of pure raw materials under low-pressure pure Ar atmosphere (450 mbar). The obtained buttons were remelted 6 times inside water-cooled copper crucible to ensure compositional homogeneity. Thereafter, the alloy was cold pressed to improve its workability and finally cold rolled into 1 mm thick laminas (90% cold work). The obtained samples were solution treated under Ar atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h and quenched in water. Such temperature was selected to obtain a single phase FCC microstructure: in fact, available CALPHAD simulations indicate that at 1000 °C the alloy falls well within a single FCC phase field. [, ]

Laser welding was performed in bead-on-plate configuration by means of an active fiber laser (mod. YLR300/3000 by IPG Photonics). The main features of the laser source are listed in Table , while the associated power distribution and laser beam caustic are depicted in Figure . Flowing Ar at a pressure of 2 bar was used as shielding gas during the experiments. Laser power was kept constant at 300 W (the maximum power of the used laser source), to maximize the productivity in the view of a possible real application of the process. On the contrary, beam focusing and scanning speed were varied according to a full factorial design, as reported in Table , to find the most suitable process condition. The effect of the varied process parameters was correlated to the main geometrical features of the welded bead, namely penetration depth and top width (see a schematic of Figure ).

PHA
On the borders of the welded bead (Figure ) a layer characterized by a relatively finer dendritic structure can be found: secondary dendritic arms spacing (SDAS) is reduced from about 2 μm in the center of the MZ to 1.4 μm along its borders. This is likely a consequence of the faster solidification rate experience by the melted material at the borders of the welded bead. Outside such area, a 50 μm thick layer (HAZ) can be recognized thanks to the presence of a Cu-rich phase decorating the boundaries of pre-existing grains, appearing as a rather continuous bright layer in Figure . The Cu enrichment characterizing the grain-boundary phase (Table ) is more limited with respect to the one measured in the interdendritic areas of the MZ: in fact, the atomic rearrangement resulting from temperature-induced diffusion is smaller with respect to the one allowed during melt solidification. Nevertheless, it may be reasonably inferred that the Cu-rich phases present in the interdendritic areas in the MZ and at grain boundaries in the HAZ are Indeed the same FCC phase. The size of the observed grains (23 μm) derives from the initial production process (cold working and solution treatment) and appears to have not been affected by the relatively fast heating - cooling cycle experienced.

Finally, the BM (Figure ) shows the typical microstructure of a recrystallized material, being characterized by a uniform distribution of equiaxed grains of the main FCC phase, with no second phases at the grain boundary. At a finer length scale, the grain interior of the main FCC phase appears to be decorated by extremely numerous, nanometric, spherical particles. Such particles have been earlier demonstrated to consist of Cu-rich atomic clusters, exhibiting FCC structure and full coherency with respect to the surrounding matrix, without any detectable difference in lattice parameter. [] Such spherical clusters could be found in the dendrite interior of MZ and inside grains of both HAZ and BM. Their average size appears to be slightly larger in the HAZ than in BM, suggesting that the heat flowing from the MZ likely caused a more extensive rearrangement of Cu atoms in the HAZ, therefore leading to the formation of larger clusters. This observation allows concluding that the HAZ is actually composed of two layers, which are characterized by different microstructures. The initial area, roughly 50 μm thick and lying next to the MZ border, experienced a stronger thermal effect, which lead to the formation of the grain boundaries of the Cu-rich FCC phase described by Sonkusare et al. [] The remaining part of the HAZ, up to 300 μm from the MZ border, likely underwent less serious heating and, as a consequence, does not show any grain boundary decoration but is mainly characterized by a limited growth of the nanometric clusters, which in turn induced an evident hardness increase with respect to the BM.

STR
Mechanical behavior of the base and the welded alloy was assessed in tensile conditions, resulting in the stress - strain curves, reported in Figure . It is immediately evident that the mechanical response in both conditions was extremely similar. All samples were characterized by an elastic modulus of 146 GPa; yielding took place at 259.4 ± 2,3 MPa in the BM and was almost negligibly decreased to 255.9 ± 3.5 MPa after welding; finally, the ultimate tensile strength was found to be 580.3 ± 4,1 MPa and 576.4 ± 1,6 MPa in base and welded conditions, respectively. Failure happened at a deformation of 28.3 ± 0.4% in the BM and at 29.0 ± 0.2% after welding. It shall be strongly underlined that, as shown in Figure , failure of welded samples did not take place inside the welded bead nor in the HAZ, but rather in the BM. As a consequence, fracture surfaces, which lied at 45° with respect to the loading direction, were homogeneous in both base and welded samples (Figure ): their morphology is characterized by rather deep dimples and shows no cleavage planes, confirming that a ductile failure of the tensile samples took place after considerable elongation. The fact that failure has never taken place in the welded bead confirms the results of hardness tests (Figure ), which showed that mechanical resistance is locally improved in the welded bead, probably due to solidification-induced stresses and the emergence of the second Cu-rich phase. Moreover, tensile tests allow confirming the extreme soundness of the obtained joint, as no critical defect was induced. This suggests that laser beam welding may be used to process the high entropy alloy at hand in the view of structural applications, as the mechanical resistance and the ductility offered by the joint are equivalent to the ones characterizing the annealed material.

In the present study, the carbon added by 0 at %, 0.5 at %, and 1.0 at % in cobalt-chromium-iron-manganese-nickel high entropy alloys were prepared by magnetic levitation melting technique with a high-purity nitrogen atmosphere to melt the cobalt, chromium, iron, manganese, nickel, and carbon elementary substances under 1650 °C for 25 min. The melting processes were repeated 4 times to attain homogeneous elemental distribution in the ingots. The cobalt-chromium-iron-manganese-nickel - (0, 0.5, and 1.0 at %) carbon ingots were solution treated at a temperature of 1100 °C for 2 hours and subsequently hot rolled with reduction of 50 % with speed of 70 m/s. Later, the rolled sheets were annealed at 800 °C for 40 min to obtain fully recrystallized microstructures. The detailed chemical composition of the prepared materials was measured by optical spectrometer analyzer, Table .

SYN
All the Cantor alloy, Si10 HEA, and Si12 HEA were prepared via arc melting of high-purity elements (purity > 99.9%) under an argon gas atmosphere, and the melting was repeated more than five times to ensure chemical homogenization. The as-cast ingots were homogenized at 1423 K for 12 h under a high-purity argon gas atmosphere, followed by water quenching to ambient temperature. The ingots were then hot-compressed to 3 mm-thick plates (50% reduction in thickness) at 1373 K in air, followed by water quenching. The oxide layers were removed by grinding and then the plates were cold rolled to 1.8 mm (40% reduction in thickness) at room temperature. Finally, the samples were annealed at 1373 K for a short period (Cantor, 10 min; Si10 HEA and Si12 HEA, 2 min), followed by water quenching to ambient temperature, to obtain recrystallized microstructures with grain sizes of approximately 60 μm (similar for the three alloys, see Fig. 1 and Table 2). The grain sizes were determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7100F) equipped with an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector. The observations were made at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV, and the EBSD data were analyzed using OIM analysis software (version 7.0).

PHA
The neutron diffraction profile (see Fig. 12) shows that both HEAs remain FCC single-phase alloys. The lattice parameters at ambient temperature are 3.571 Å (Si10 HEA) and 3.569 Å (Si12 HEA), which are smaller than that of the base Cantor alloy (3.597 Å) [58]. Because the atomic radius of metalloid Si (1.153 Å) is smaller than those of metallic Mn (1.350 Å), Co (1.251 Å), Cr (1.249 Å), Fe (1.241 Å), and Ni (1.246 Å), which are equal to half the shortest interatomic distance in condensed metals [59-61]. These Si-containing HEAs exhibit larger values of mean square atomic displacement (MSAD) than the Cantor alloy, (see Fig. 5 a) both for each element and for their average value; a larger MSAD value represents a more severe local lattice distortion (LLD). Therefore, the two Si-containing HEAs are FCC solid solutions without segregation or clustering, but the Si substitution clearly escalates LLD. This is expected to effectively increase the strength [62], from the solid solution strengthening theory, which purports that atomic size and modulus misfits would cause an increased frictional force against dislocation slip [63-65]. There is also a change in the shear modulus from 82 GPa (CoCrFeMnNi) and 85 GPa (CoCrFeNi) to 72.3 GPa (Si10 HEA) and 74.2 GPa (Si12 HEA) (Table 2 ).

STR
We first report their impressive behavior in standard tensile tests, to make the point that their simultaneous elevation of strength and ductility, with respect to the base Cantor alloy, is attractive and worthy of detailed investigation (to be pursued in the succeeding sub-sections). Fig. 2 a shows the tensile stress-strain curves of the HEAs at room temperature. Here, the alloys being compared have almost identical grain sizes (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The 0.2% offset yield strength increased from 201 MPa (Cantor alloy) to 306 MPa (Si10 HEA) and 332 MPa (Si12 HEA). The ultimate tensile strength has been raised from 543 MPa (Cantor alloy) to 792 MPa (Si10 HEA) and 843 MPa (Si12 HEA). Of special note is that the Si-substituted HEAs exhibit a very high strain-hardening rate, as shown in Fig. 2b, which only slowly decreases during tensile deformation. This delays the initiation of necking to 60% true strain when the strain hardening rate (the upper purple curve) intersects the true stress curve (the lower purple stress-strain curve), as known from the Considere criterion. The engineering uniform tensile strain is as high as ~85%, whereas the total tensile strain to failure reaches almost 100%, both exceeding the best of all known metals at room temperature. Compared with the Cantor alloy, this percent elongation is approximately 30% higher. Similarly, a Ge-containing HEA (Fig. S7) also exhibited such simultaneously enhanced strength and ductility. The mechanical properties for both the Si- and Ge- substituted HEAs could be improved even more via further optimization of composition and thermomechanical processing. Previously, replacing Mn with Pd in the Cantor alloy enhanced the yield and ultimate tensile strengths but decreased the tensile elongation [6]. Overall, the combination of strength and tensile ductility of the Si-containing HEAs, as indicated in Fig. 2c, is unprecedented compared with other single- or multiple- phase HEAs and conventional alloys [52]. Fig. 2d compares the changes in strength and ductility of FCC HEAs tailored using metallic elements in the literature with the HEAs containing metalloids (Si and Ge) in the present study. The addition of metallic constituents, such as Al, Hf, Mo, Nb, and W, generally strengthens the HEA while compromising its ductility [9,10,53-56]. In contrast, the metalloidal Si and Ge are able to evade this trade-off, with a synergistic strength-ductility combination that distinguishes the tailored HEAs from other metallic materials. Obviously, the increase in strength and ductility must have its origin in the micro- and nano- scale structure in the alloy, which we analyze in detail in the following.

Ingots of Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were fabricated by vacuum arc-melting of pure metals (purity > 99.9 wt.%) under an inert gas (high-purity argon) atmosphere. After melting, they were cooled in a water-cooled copper mold and flipped and re-melted five times to improve compositional homogeneity. Subsequently, the ingots were cold-rolled to a 30% reduction in thickness and homogenized at 1100 °C for 24 h. Then, the homogenized plate of the Co60Ni40 alloy and the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were further cold-rolled to a 92% reduction in thickness and annealed at 750 °C for 120 s and 850 °C for 3.6 ks, respectively. These processes yielded fully-recrystallized microstructures of FCC single phase having similar mean grain sizes of about 3 μm (including annealing twins) in the two alloys.

PHA
The material properties of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA are listed in Table 1 . The lattice constants of FCC structure were determined to be 0.3535 nm and 0.3559 nm for the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA, respectively, based on the synchrotron XRD measurements before deformation. The friction stresses of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were determined to be 52 MPa and 280 MPa, respectively, at room temperature based on our previous studies [40,41,55]. Figs. 1 (a) and (b) show SEM-BSE micrographs of initial microstructures of the Co60Ni40 and Co20Cr40Ni40, respectively. Equiaxed grains with profuse annealing twin boundaries were seen in both alloys. Textures of these materials were close to random, given the characteristics of recrystallization texture in FCC metals [70]. Mean grain sizes of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were found to be 3.10 μm and 2.79 μm by the intercept method. Other material properties (SFE, homologous temperature at room temperature, shear modulus, and the Hall-Petch slope) were extracted from the literature [41,42,51,71]. It should be noted that the accuracy of the SFE values reported in the literature [53,54] was verified again based on separation distance of dissociated dislocations measured by our own WBDF-TEM observations [72], and possible artifacts due to the high friction stress of the MEA, pointed out by some recent studies [73-75], were technically avoided by observing multiple grains with different orientations (see supplementary materials for the details). It is also noteworthy that the elastic anisotropies of the two alloys, which are related to atomic bonding state in crystals, were experimentally estimated to be comparable, as described later in Section 3.5. Therefore, average energy landscape of generalized SFE and resultant twinability [76] of the materials are expected to be comparable, according to the literature [77-80]. The data above clearly indicate that the material properties of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were very close, except for the friction stresses.

STR
Fig. 2 (a) plots the engineering stress - engineering strain curves of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA. The yield strength (0.2% proof stress) of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were 140 MPa and 375 MPa, respectively. The contribution of grain size to the yield strength (the Hall-Petch effect), kd -1/2, can be calculated as 103 MPa and 101 MPa for the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA, respectively, based on their nearly identical Hall-Petch slopes, as shown in Table 1. Therefore, the difference in the yield strength (235 MPa) corresponds well with the difference in the friction stress (= 228 MPa) in the materials. The ultimate tensile strengths of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were 419 MPa and 685 MPa, respectively. Generally, there is a trade-off relationship between strength and ductility of materials. Thus, materials having higher strength tend to exhibit lower ductility. However, despite the difference in the flow stress, interestingly, the two alloys showed almost the same ductility (fractured at e ~ 0.72). Fig. 2(b) shows work-hardening rate - true strain curves of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA plotted together with the true stress - true strain curves. It was found that the work-hardening rate of the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA was higher than that of the Co60Ni40 alloy. The crossing points between the work-hardening rate curves and the true stress - true strain curves are where necking occurs, satisfying the plastic instability condition [49], expressed as (1) d σ d ε ≤ σ , where σ and ε are true stress and true strain, respectively. Eq. (1) suggests that necking was retarded in the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA owing to the higher work-hardening ability, resulting in a similar uniform and fracture elongations as in the Co60Ni40 alloy.
