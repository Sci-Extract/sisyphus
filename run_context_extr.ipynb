The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm).\n",

      "A synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out at the Pohang Steel and Iron Corporation beamline for phase characterization and estimation of dislocation density. The XRD analysis was conducted with a resolution of ΔE/E = 2 × 10-4, 2θ from 30° to 100°, a step size of 0.02°, and a scan speed of 1° min-1 using monochromator filter. The dislocation density of samples was estimated from the XRD patterns by applying the \"convolution multiple whole profile\" (CMWP) method. An electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was conducted on the annealed sample (before HPT processing) with a step size of 50 nm in the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI XL30S). The TSL OIM Analysis 7 software was used to interpret the EBSD data. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was performed on the HPT-processed samples using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV (JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). The TEM samples were mechanically polished to a thickness of ≈60 μm, and electro-polishing with a solution containing 10% of HClO4 and 90% of CH3COOH was performed at room temperature using a voltage of 25 V.\n",

The tensile specimens were cut from the disk, such that a gauge length of 1.5 mm is located 2.5 mm away from the HPT disc center. Room temperature tensile tests were carried out at a quasi-static strain rate of 1 × 10-3 s-1 using a universal testing machine (Instron 1361, Instron Crop.. USA). The tensile samples were sprayed with black and white speckles on the specimen surface before tensile testing, and a digital image correlation method with an optical 3D deformation analysis (DIC; ARAMIS v6.1, GOM Optical Tech.) was used to measure the tensile strain. Vickers microhardness tests on the HPT samples were performed across the radial direction by applying a load of 500 g and a holding time of 10 s.\n",

      "The engineering stress versus strain curves of the FG and CG samples before and after HPT processing at different turns (1/4, 1, and 5 turns) are shown in Figure . The tensile curves indicate that samples in annealed condition exhibit low yield strength (YS) and high elongation to failure, whereas the HPT processing led to an enhancement in YS accompanied by a reduction in the elongation to failure. The strength-ductility trade-off is in agreement with the classic mechanical response of ultra-fine grained (UFG) metallic materials processed by SPD techniques. Table summarizes the relative data for the engineering YS, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and total elongation to failure (δ) for both the FG and CG samples. The CG sample in annealed condition shows a YS of ≈230 MPa, and the FG sample shows a relatively higher YS of ≈430 MPa. The higher YS observed in the FG sample can be attributed to the Hall-Petch strengthening effect. The UTSs of the FG and CG samples are 751 and 532 MPa, respectively, and the CG sample presents slightly higher total elongation to failure in comparison with the FG sample (CG ≈58% and FG ≈48%).\n",
