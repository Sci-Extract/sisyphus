<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 7</strong></div><div>The Al0.3CoCrFeNi (composition is in atomic percent, at. %) ingot was prepared using high-purity elements using vacuum-levitation melting. The cast ingot was hot forged and hot (rotary) swaged into rods of 6 mm in diameter at 1050 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. The rods were subsequently drawn into HEA fibers with diameters of 1.0 mm and 1.6 mm at 900 °C. Additional details of the wire drawing are described elsewhere [24]. Subsequently, the HEA fibers were annealed at 900 °C for 10 min, 30 min, 300 min and 720 min, respectively. After heat treatment, the fibers had an equiaxed grain structure.</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag synthesis">synthesis</span></div></div>

The XRD patterns (Fig. 1) reveal the FCC phase in all four processing states. The peaks near 30° can be identified as B2 phase according to previous studies [41,42].

<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 11</strong></div><div>Fig. 2 shows microstructural features, including grain morphologies, recrystallization and texture evolution in the 1.0 mm diameter Al0.3CoCrFeNi fibers after annealing. A large quantity of precipitates and annealing twins was observed in most of the grains in the annealed state (Fig. 2 (a1)-(d1) and Fig. 2 (a2) - (d2)). The average size of random oriented grains was found to be around 2 μm. There are also a large number of nano-sized spherical precipitates on nearby grain boundaries. It was observed that increasing the annealing time from 0 to 300 min resulted in a slight increase in the volume fraction and size of the B2 phase (Fig. 2 (a1) - (c1)). When annealed for 720 min, the fraction of B2 phase decreases (Fig. 2 (d1)). EDS analysis indicates that these precipitates are rich in Ni and Al, as listed in Table 1 , and agree with prior CALPHAD modeling and experimental studies [30,31,43].</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag phase">phase</span><span class="tag grain_size">grain_size</span></div></div>
<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 14</strong></div><div>It is well known that precipitation strengthening is critically dependent on the precipitate type, size, number density and distribution. To further investigate the role and the phase structures of precipitates, TEM of annealed material was performed. Fig. 4 shows the TEM results for the 1.0 mm diameter fibers at 900 °C for 720 min exposure. The microstructure consists of FCC matrix with B2 precipitate particles. This was verified from selected area diffraction patterns (SADP) (Fig. 4 (b) and (c)).</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag phase">phase</span></div></div>

<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 13</strong></div><div>Fig. 3 shows grain morphologies and texture evolution of the annealed 1.6 mm diameter Al0.3CoCrFeNi fibers. Anomalous grain growth (Fig. 3b) was observed after annealing for 30 min. The grain size distribution was relatively normal for the longer annealing times. In this polycrystalline HEA fiber, the occurrence of abnormal grain growth at short annealing times was attributed to the cooperation of texture and segregation of precipitates at grain boundaries. The grain boundary structural transformations led to a change in the mobility of some grain boundaries and allowed them to migrate at a rate faster than the average.</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag grain_size">grain_size</span></div></div>
<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 15</strong></div><div>Fig. 5 shows the change in grain size as a function of annealing time. Grain growth was rapid up to 30 min exposure, and then decreased substantially with increasing exposure time (Fig. 5). After annealing for 720 min, the average grain sizes, measured using linear intercept method, were smaller than 3 μm for both 1.0 mm and 1.6 mm diameter fibers. For many polycrystalline materials, the relationship between grain diameter d with time t can be described by the following equation [44,45]: d f - d 0 = K t n where d f and d 0 are the final and initial grain diameter at time t and time t = 0, respectively, K is the grain growth rate coefficient, and n is the growth exponent. Burke et al. obtained a theoretical value of n = 0.5 for the grain growth exponent of metals. Experimental studies, on the other hand, show that n is generally well below this value [46]. In the present study, the calculated values for n and K were ~0.20 and 0.19 (μm s-1) for the 1.0 mm diameter fibers and ~0.29 and 0.10 (μm s-1) for the 1.6 mm diameter fibers (30 min annealing time at 900 °C). For annealing times greater than 30 min, grain growth slows down, and the values for n and K values are ~0.05 and 0.10 (μm s-1) for the 1.0 mm diameter fibers and ~0.25 and 0.11 (μm s-1) for the 1.6 mm diameter fibers.</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag grain_size">grain_size</span></div></div>
<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 18</strong></div><div>Fig. 7 compares the ultimate tensile strength (σ f ) and yield strength (σy) against elongation-to-fracture for Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA fibers and other traditional alloy fibers (including Cu-Sn, Cu-Al-Ni, Cu-Al, Ni-Mn-Ga, Zn-Li, Cu, Mg-Y-Zn, and 316 stainless) at room temperature. The mechanical properties of Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA fibers vary considerably depending on the processing conditions. Clearly both σ f and σy of Al0.3CoCrFeNi fibers greatly exceed those of other traditional alloy fibers, and this can be attributed to solid-solution hardening characteristic of HEAs, grain boundary hardening (i.e.. extremely fine grain sizes of &lt;3 μm), precipitation hardening (i.e.. high-density fine B2 precipitates), and dislocation hardening.</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag grain_size">grain_size</span></div></div>

<div class="para"><div><strong>Paragraph 17</strong></div><div>The mechanical properties (specifically, ultimate tensile strength (σ f ), yield stress (σ y ), and elongation-to-fracture (ε f )) of the 1.0 mm and 1.6 mm Al0.3CoCrFeNi fibers in the four annealed states are presented in Fig. 6 (see Table 2 for values). For the four annealing states, σ f and σ y decrease monotonically with increasing annealing time at temperature, while the elongation-to-fracture increases. The decrease in σ f and σ y and increase in elongation-to-fracture are rapid only for annealing time under 30 min, and then progress slowly thereafter. The 1.0 mm diameter fibers after annealing for 10 min exhibit σy of ~600 MPa, σ f of ~980 MPa with elongation of 25%. The tensile strength (σ f ) of this alloy at room temperature is comparable to that of the as-cast and forged Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy [21]. The tensile test results for the 1.0 mm diameter fibers are not significantly different from the 1.6 mm diameter fibers.</div><div class="tags"><span class="tag strength">strength</span></div></div>
