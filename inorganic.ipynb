White precipitate appeared immediately and was stirred for 5 h to complete the precipitation reaction.

The reactant powders were thoroughly ground together into a homogeneous mixture using a mortar and pestle, transferred to an alumina crucible, and subsequently heated in air at different temperatures for 12 h.
