The obtained Dmag values are between 27.67 and 33.60 nm and this range isingreat accordance with theresults calculated from XRD measurements.

    "Design and exploratory synthesis of new mid-infrared (mid-IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are urgently needed for modern laser science and technology because the widely used IR NLO crystals still suffer from their inextricable drawbacks. Herein, a multi-level data-driven approach to realize fast and efficient structure prediction for the exploration of promising mid-IR NLO materials is proposed. Techniques based on machine learning, crystal structure prediction, high-throughput calculation and screening, database building, and experimental verification are tightly combined for creating pathways from chemical compositions, crystal structures to rational synthesis. Through this data-driven approach, not only are all known structures successfully predicted but also five thermodynamically stable and 50 metastable new selenides in AIBIIISe2 systems (AI = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs; BIII = Al and Ga) are found, among which eight outstanding compounds with wide bandgaps (> 2.70 eV) and large SHG responses ( > 10 pm V-1) are suggested. Moreover, the predicted compounds I 4 ¯ 2d-LiGaSe2 and I4/mcm-KAlSe2 are successfully obtained experimentally. In particular, LiGaSe2 exhibits a robust SHG response ( ≈ 2 × AGS) and long IR absorption edge that can cover two atmospheric windows (3-5, 8-12 µm). Simultaneously, this new research paradigm is also applicative for discovering new materials in other fields.\"\"\"\n",

MgSiAs2 belongs to the well-known II-IV-V2 family, which is extensively studied experimentally and computationally for their optical properties. MgSiAs2 is computationally predicted but not experimentally known prior to this work. Mg3Si6As8 crystallizes in a new non-centrosymmetric cubic chiral structure type with the Pearson symbol cP68. The syntheses, crystal structure, thermal and chemical stabilities, electronic structures, and optical properties of these two new compounds are investigated in this work. Optical absorption measurements and electronic structure calculations reveal the two compounds to be direct or pseudo-direct bandgap semiconductors (1.8-2 eV). The crystal structures of both compounds are non-centrosymmetric, though Mg3Si6As8 belongs to the 432 chiral crystal class, which is optically active but does not exhibit second harmonic generation (SHG) behavior. The SHG response of MgSiAs2 is 60% of that for AgGaS2, but MgSiAs2 exhibits a higher laser damage threshold than AgGaS2 at 33.2 MW cm-2.\"\"\"\n",

Introducing the (BO3F)4-, (BO2F2)3-, and (BOF3)2- groups in borates could break through the fixed 3D B-O network that would produce a larger birefringence without layering and simultaneously keep a short cutoff edge down to DUV.

Li2B6O9F2 is identified as a DUV NLO material with a large second harmonic generation efficiency (0.9×KDP) and a large predicted birefringence (0.07) without layering. This study provides a feasible way to break down the DUV wall for NLO materials.\\n\\n\\nTo further check the ability of the [BOF] groups to improve NLO performance, we investigated the structure-properties relationship of some fluorooxoborates including LiB6O9F, Li2B6O9F2, Li2B3O4F3, and Na2B6O9F2. Among them, three lithium fluorooxoborates (hereinafter referred to as LBOFs) are non-centrosymmetric and exhibit SHG response. Na2B6O9F2 is centrosymmetric and has a large band gap and birefringence. As shown in Figure , the introducing of the (BO3F) and (BO2F2) groups \"cut through\" the fixed 3D B-O network to form a corrugated layers, a branched 3D framework, and a zigzag chain in LiB6O9F, Li2B6O9F2, and Li2B3O4F3, respectively. The incorporation of (BO3F)4- and (BO2F2)3- in LBOFs also avoids the appearance of terminal oxygen atoms and is expected to give a large band gap since the terminal fluoride atom is far more electronegative than oxygen. To evaluate the band gap and structure-properties relationship, the electronic structures of LBOFs are calculated using the plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) method by employing CASTEP package. Computational details and methods are described in the Supporting Information. The band structures of LBOFs are shown in Figure S1. The results show that all of them have similar calculated band gaps to that of LBO (Table ). We also use hybrid functional based on a screened Coulomb potential HSE06 to more precisely predict the band gaps of LBOFs. The predicted band gap of LBO using HSE06 functional is 8.28 eV which is very close to the experimental one of 8.00 eV. All the predicted band gaps of the LBOFs are larger than 8.0 eV, which indicates that LBOFs have a wide transparency window down to DUV.'), info=[{'material': 'LiB6O9F', 'band_gap': '>8.0', 'direct_or_indirect': 'unknown', 'optical_or_electronic': 'electronic'}, {'material': 'Li2B6O9F2', 'band_gap': '>8.0', 'direct_or_indirect': 'unknown', 'optical_or_electronic': 'electronic'}, {'material': 'Li2B3O4F3', 'band_gap': '>8.0', 'direct_or_indirect': 'unknown', 'optical_or_electronic': 'electronic'}, {'material': 'Na2B6O9F2', 'band_gap': '>8.0', 'direct_or_indirect': 'unknown', 'optical_or_electronic': 'electronic'}, {'material': 'LiB3O5', 'band_gap': '8.28', 'direct_or_indirect': 'unknown', 'optical_or_electronic': 'electronic'}, {'material': 'LiB3O5', 'band_gap': '8.00', 'direct_or_indirect': 'unknown', 'optical_or_electronic': 'unknown'}]),\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "Deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) crystals are the key materials to extend the output range of solid-state lasers to below 200 nm. The only practical material KBe2BO3F2 suffers high toxicity through beryllium and strong layered growth. Herein, we propose a beryllium-free material design and synthesis strategy for DUV NLO materials. Introducing the (BO3F)4-, (BO2F2)3-, and (BOF3)2- groups in borates could break through the fixed 3D B-O network that would produce a larger birefringence without layering and simultaneously keep a short cutoff edge down to DUV. The theoretical and experimental studies on a series of fluorooxoborates confirm this strategy. Li2B6O9F2 is identified as a DUV NLO material with a large second harmonic generation efficiency (0.9×KDP) and a large predicted birefringence (0.07) without layering. This study provides a feasible way to break down the DUV wall for NLO materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike layered KBBF, LiB3O5 (LBO) is a crystal that could grow to a large size, has appropriate SHG coefficients, and a wide transparency window. In LBO, all the oxygen atoms are connected with two boron atoms to form a three-dimensional (3D) B-O framework without terminal oxygen atoms, thus avoiding layering and resulting in a short transmittance cutoff edge of 155 nm. However, the space arrangements of the (B3O7)5- screw chain lead to a relatively small birefringence that impedes the realization of phase matchability in the DUV region. Similar situations exist in CsB3O5 (CBO) and CsLiB6O10 (CLBO) that are also constructed by the (B3O7)5- groups. As shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information, the fixed 3D B-O network structures in which all the oxygen atoms are connected by two boron atoms, are unfavorable to produce relatively large birefringence ( ≥ 0.07@1064 nm).\n",
