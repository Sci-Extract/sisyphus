The starting materials were high-purity grade powders (> 99%): CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, Na2CO3 and TiO2. CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.",
