Second, the resulting mixture was further heated for one day at 1200 °C until a transparent and clear melt was formed. Third, the melt was allowed to cool slowly (3 °C h-1) to the final crystallization temperature (1100 °C). Finally, the obtained mixture was quenched to room temperature. Colorless, transparent crystals were obtained for structure determination.

    "test_text = \"In 2004, Kudo and coworkers first reported the photocatalytic activities of SnNb2O6, Sn2Nb2O7, SnTa2O6 and Sn2Ta2O7 for hydrogen evolution, using methanol as the sacrificial reagent. The photocatalysts were synthesized using solid-state synthesis, and the photocatalytic activity was measured under visible irradiation for the tin niobate structures (λ > 420 nm) and under UV irradiation for the tin tantalate structures (λ > 300 nm). The two tin tantalate structures were shown to be less interesting due to their wide band gaps and low photocatalytic activity, as the hydrogen evolution activity of Sn2Ta2O7 was reported to be approximately 2.1 μmol h-1 and SnTa2O6 was found to be inactive. Interestingly, although the two tin niobate structures show similar band gaps of approximately 2.3 eV, the SnNb2O6 structure's optimized hydrogen evolution rate was found to be 18 μmol h-1, with a turnover number (TON) of 180 at 10 h. summarizes all the materials that have been used as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Later in 2006, Kudo and coworkers reported the flux-assisted synthesis of SnNb2O6 starting from a Sr2Nb2O7 perovskite structure with SnCl2 as a molten salt. The synthesis proceeds through an ion exchange mechanism at a low temperature of 300 °C for a long time of 30 h, where Sn2+ replaces the Sr2+, resulting in a layered structure. Although the flux-assisted method resulted in a nanoplate material with a higher surface area in comparison to the bulk tin niobate synthesized by the solid-state method, it did not improve the activity, which may be attributed to the decreased crystallinity.\"\n",

White precipitate appeared immediately and was stirred for 5 h to complete the precipitation reaction. The precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water thoroughly and dried at 80 °C in air. The final BiOCl powder was obtained as seen from XRD patterns (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). In what followed, BiOCl and Ca(NO3)2 (1:1 molar ratio) were used to synthesize CaBiO2Cl by a solid-state reaction. The reactant powders were thoroughly ground together into a homogeneous mixture using a mortar and pestle, transferred to an alumina crucible, and subsequently heated in air at different temperatures for 12 h. A pale yellow polycrystalline powder (CaBiO2Cl) was obtained from the reactions.

Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000 °C for 5 h in air.\n",

The starting materials were high-purity grade powders (> 99%): CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, Na2CO3 and TiO2. CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",

XRF measurements gave the Fe depth distribution, whilst Mossbauer spectroscopy and XAFS provided information about changes in local structure. Synthesis and characterisation of a new four-layer Aurivillius phase Bi2SrNa2Nb4O15 was reported by Liang et al.393 Following a solid state reaction of Bi2SrNa2Nb4O9 and NaNbO3 at 1100 °C, XRD was used to show the resultant crystalline structure and XRF and thermogravimetry used for the measurement of composition the multilayers formed.\n",

The starting materials of Bi(NO3)3 and KCl (1:1 molar ratio) were mixed together, and then 60 mL of distilled water was added. White precipitate appeared immediately and was stirred for 5 h to complete the precipitation reaction. The precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water thoroughly and dried at 80 °C in air. The final BiOCl powder was obtained as seen from XRD patterns (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). In what followed, BiOCl and Ca(NO3)2 (1:1 molar ratio) were used to synthesize CaBiO2Cl by a solid-state reaction. The reactant powders were thoroughly ground together into a homogeneous mixture using a mortar and pestle, transferred to an alumina crucible, and subsequently heated in air at different temperatures for 12 h. A pale yellow polycrystalline powder (CaBiO2Cl) was obtained from the reactions. TiO2-xNx known for its good photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of pollutants under visible-light irradiation, was also prepared as a reference.\n",

      "The BaCe0.7In0.15Ta0.05Y0.1O3-δ (BCITY) powder was prepared by combing solid state reaction and Pechini method to ensure homogeneity of mixed oxides. Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000 °C for 5 h in air.\n",

The starting materials were high-purity grade powders (> 99%): CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, Na2CO3 and TiO2. CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",

      "The BaCe0.7In0.15Ta0.05Y0.1O3-δ (BCITY) powder was prepared by combing solid state reaction and Pechini method to ensure homogeneity of mixed oxides. Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000 °C for 5 h in air.\n",

The starting materials were high-purity grade powders (> 99%): CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, Na2CO3 and TiO2. CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",

      "In 2004, Kudo and coworkers first reported the photocatalytic activities of SnNb2O6, Sn2Nb2O7, SnTa2O6 and Sn2Ta2O7 for hydrogen evolution, using methanol as the sacrificial reagent. The photocatalysts were synthesized using solid-state synthesis, and the photocatalytic activity was measured under visible irradiation for the tin niobate structures (λ > 420 nm) and under UV irradiation for the tin tantalate structures (λ > 300 nm). The two tin tantalate structures were shown to be less interesting due to their wide band gaps and low photocatalytic activity, as the hydrogen evolution activity of Sn2Ta2O7 was reported to be approximately 2.1 μmol h-1 and SnTa2O6 was found to be inactive. Interestingly, although the two tin niobate structures show similar band gaps of approximately 2.3 eV, the SnNb2O6 structure's optimized hydrogen evolution rate was found to be 18 μmol h-1, with a turnover number (TON) of 180 at 10 h. summarizes all the materials that have been used as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Later in 2006, Kudo and coworkers reported the flux-assisted synthesis of SnNb2O6 starting from a Sr2Nb2O7 perovskite structure with SnCl2 as a molten salt. The synthesis proceeds through an ion exchange mechanism at a low temperature of 300 °C for a long time of 30 h, where Sn2+ replaces the Sr2+, resulting in a layered structure. Although the flux-assisted method resulted in a nanoplate material with a higher surface area in comparison to the bulk tin niobate synthesized by the solid-state method, it did not improve the activity, which may be attributed to the decreased crystallinity.\n",

The method presented here provides powder samples with good crystalline properties as shown by X-ray diffraction measurements.

      "The BaCe0.7In0.15Ta0.05Y0.1O3-δ (BCITY) powder was prepared by combing solid state reaction and Pechini method to ensure homogeneity of mixed oxides. Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000 °C for 5 h in air.\n",

The starting materials were high-purity grade powders (> 99%): CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, Na2CO3 and TiO2. CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",

      "The BaCe0.7In0.15Ta0.05Y0.1O3-δ (BCITY) powder was prepared by combing solid state reaction and Pechini method to ensure homogeneity of mixed oxides. Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000 °C for 5 h in air.\n",

The starting materials were high-purity grade powders (> 99%): CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, Na2CO3 and TiO2. CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",

Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. In addition, the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ (BCY) powder was also prepared by Pechini method and calcined at 1000 °C for 5 h in air.\n",

CST and BNT powders were synthesized separately by mixing the starting materials according to the desired stoichiometry, and milled with ZrO2 balls and deionized water for 6 h in nylon jars. After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x = 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x = 0.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation. Microstructures of the surfaces were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5900) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",
