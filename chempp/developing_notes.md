## Developing notes for chem paper parser

### Preface
This project is a modified version of Yinghao-Li's chemical html paper parser. [Click here](https://github.com/Yinghao-Li/ChemistryHTMLPaperParser)
- The goal of this project is to construct a consistency format among multiple publishers and build a bridge for later processing (database creation) for sisyhpus.

### TODO
- Elsevier paper reference tag removing (support ACS, RSC, Wiley presently)
- Support more publishers (support ACS, RSC, Wiley, Elsevier, Springer, Nature presently)
