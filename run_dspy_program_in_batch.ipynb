After drying, the powders were calcined at 1100 °C for 3 h and 850 °C for 3 h, respectively. The resulting powders were re-milled for 6 h. After that, the dried and re-milled mixtures were granulated with appropriate poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder and uniaxial pressed at 300 MPa into cylinders with approximate size of 15 mm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The cylinders with x\\u2009=\\u20090.05, 0.075 and 0.1 were sintered in air at 1225–1300 °C for 3 h, and the cylinders with x\\u2009=\\u20090.025 were sintered in air at 1275–1375 °C for 3 h. Phase identification of the sintered products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU; SmartLab 3) using CuKα radiation.

White precipitate appeared immediately and was stirred for 5 h to complete the precipitation reaction.

      "Synthesis of Mesoporous LTO: Poly(isoprene) -b-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer (PI-b-PEO) was synthesized by anionic polymerization. The Mn value and PEO fraction of PI-b-PEO used were found to be 30,000 g mol-1 and 0.06, respectively. PI-b-PEO has narrow weight distributions with a polydispersity index of 1.13. This PI-b-PEO block copolymer was used both as a structure directing agent as well as carbon source. Initially, 0.2 g of PI-b-PEO was dissolved in a mixture of 4 ml of THF. The inorganic precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.287 ml of TTIP (titanium tetraisopropoxide) and 0.181g of lithium ethoxide (3.48 mL of 1 M LiOC2H5 in THF stock solution). 0.39 g of Oxalic acid was then added to the inorganic precursor solution. Block copolymer solution and inorganic precursor were mixed and stirred for 2 h. Films were cast by evaporation of the solvents on a hot plate at 50 °C, and further dried at 130 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. The as-synthesized films were heat-treated to 700 °C under N2 and held for 2 h. To prepare bulk the LTO sample, a typical solid-state method was employed using a stoichiometric amount of TiO2 (anatase) and Li2CO3. The mixture powder was heat-treated at 800 °C for 20 h under atmosphere. (Supporting Information, Figure S2: XRD pattern of bulk LTO, Figure S3: SEM of bulk LTO)\n",

      "Electrochemical Characterization: The mesoporous LTO/C composite electrodes were prepared by spreading LTO/C powders, CB (super C65, TIMCAL Ltd.), and PVDF on a piece of Cu foil. 2032-type coin cells with two-electrodes (Mesoporous LTO/C)/Li were assembled in an Ar-filled dry box. 1.0 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 volume ratio) was used as the electrolyte. Porous 25 μm thick polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene/PP trilayer film (2325, Celgard) were used as separators. Unless specifically specified, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling was performed between 1.0-2.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) at different C-rates at room temperature. In this report, lithiation was expressed as discharging and de-lithiation as charging because Li foil was used as the counter electrode in the HCs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study was performed using a 1280C Solartron instrument. The AC impedance measurements were recorded using a signal with an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range from 500 kHz to 5 mHz. The first measurement was performed using the LTO/Li half cells after pre-cycling between 1.0-2.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) or 0.005-2.500 V (vs. Li/Li+), and subsequently discharging up to 60 mA h g-1. After the measured LTO/Li HCs were disassembled, the collected LTO electrodes were reassembled as LTO/LTO SCs inside the glove box. Then, the second measurement was performed using the LTO/LTO SCs. The composition of the electrodes used for the EIS measurements was 80:10:10 (LTO:CB:PVDF weight ratio). The specific capacity is based on the total weight of LTO and carbon. In this report, lithiation is expressed as discharging and delithiation as charging because Li foil is used as the counter electrode in the HCs.\n",

      "Synthesis of Mesoporous LTO: Poly(isoprene) -b-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer (PI-b-PEO) was synthesized by anionic polymerization. The Mn value and PEO fraction of PI-b-PEO used were found to be 30,000 g mol-1 and 0.06, respectively. PI-b-PEO has narrow weight distributions with a polydispersity index of 1.13. This PI-b-PEO block copolymer was used both as a structure directing agent as well as carbon source. Initially, 0.2 g of PI-b-PEO was dissolved in a mixture of 4 ml of THF. The inorganic precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.287 ml of TTIP (titanium tetraisopropoxide) and 0.181g of lithium ethoxide (3.48 mL of 1 M LiOC2H5 in THF stock solution). 0.39 g of Oxalic acid was then added to the inorganic precursor solution. Block copolymer solution and inorganic precursor were mixed and stirred for 2 h. Films were cast by evaporation of the solvents on a hot plate at 50 °C, and further dried at 130 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. The as-synthesized films were heat-treated to 700 °C under N2 and held for 2 h. To prepare bulk the LTO sample, a typical solid-state method was employed using a stoichiometric amount of TiO2 (anatase) and Li2CO3. The mixture powder was heat-treated at 800 °C for 20 h under atmosphere. (Supporting Information, Figure S2: XRD pattern of bulk LTO, Figure S3: SEM of bulk LTO)\n",

      "In recent research, the optical absorption and photocatalytic activities of metal oxides have been investigated with the use of a low-temperature AgNO3 flux to yield silver-exchanged metal oxides. Silver-exchange reactions of the layered RbLaNb2O7, RbA2Nb3O10 (A = Ca, Sr), and Rb2La2Ti3O10 perovskite structures were found to yield the AgLaNb2O7, AgA2Nb3O10 and Ag2La2Ti3O10 phases that exhibited a pronounced red-shift in the optical absorption edge by ~0.5 to ~1.0 eV. After the silver-exchange reactions, the particles were shown to maintain their original morphologies and sizes, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 7 for RbLaNb2O7 and AgLaNb2O7. Electronic structure calculations confirmed the formation of a new higher-energy valence band comprised primarily of the Ag 4d10 orbitals in each of these layered structures. All silver-exchanged products exhibited significant increases in their photocatalytic rates for hydrogen production. The silver-exchanged RbA2Nb3O10 structures, i.e.. AgA2Nb3O10, exhibited the largest increase in the photocatalytic rates for hydrogen production in aqueous methanol under ultraviolet and visible irradiation ( ~ 13616 μmol H2 g-1 h-1) compared to before silver-exchange ( ~ 1418 μmol H2 g-1 h-1). The photocatalytic rates were also found to increase exponentially over time as the Ag(I) cations were reduced on the surfaces and interlayer spacings as Ag(s) nanoislands that function as cocatalysts.\n",

      "Phases containing transition-metal cations with higher oxidation states (e.g.. LaFeO3) can be stabilized by superoxides and peroxides that form in alkali-metal hydroxide fluxes at lower reaction temperatures, e.g.. NaOH-KOH eutectic. The crystalline rare-earth orthoferrites LnFeO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) have been synthesized by flux methods at a temperature of 400 °C using a molten hydroxide in a 10:1 flux-to-reactant molar ratio. The syntheses of the LnFeO3 phases were attempted by means of a eutectic NaOH-KOH flux with a heating temperature of 300-500 °C and a reaction time of 6-24 h. The hydroxide eutectic flux has a reduced melting point and increased oxobasicity from incorporating KOH. These reaction conditions did not yield a phase-pure product; therefore, the syntheses were attempted via a pure NaOH or KOH flux. Phase-pure LnFeO3 products were formed using a NaOH flux, but the metastable phases were not observed when using only a more basic molten KOH flux. The flux preparation using a NaOH flux yielded crystals with sizes of 5-10 μm and a cube morphology indicative of growth along the {100}, as shown in Fig. 11.\n",

      "S1 in the ESI.† Modification of ex-Ca2Nb3O10/K+ with cocatalysts was carried out by impregnation of an aqueous solution containing one of the ammine complexes of metals such as [Pt(NH3)4](OH)2, [(NH3)Ru-O-Ru(NH3)4-O-Ru(NH3)5]Cl6, [Ir(NH3)6]Cl3, [Rh(NH3)6]Cl3 and [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, followed by heating in air at 773 K for 1 h. Since the dominant valence states of these metal species after the loading procedure were confirmed to be Pt2+, Ru4+, Ir4+, and Rh3+ by X-ray photoabsorption spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC Phai MT-5500), the samples loaded with the cocatalysts will be denoted as PtO, RuO2, IrO2 and Rh2O3-loaded one, respectively. On the other hand, the samples loaded with Co species were confirmed to contain both Co2+ and Co3+ states, therefore will be denoted as CoOx-loaded one for simplification. The products will be denoted as MOy/ex-Ca2Nb3O10/K+ (MOy = PtO, RuO2, IrO2, Rh2O3 and CoOx). When the protonated forms of these samples are required, the K+ cations existing in the MOy/ex-Ca2Nb3O10/K+ samples were replaced with H+ by stirring in an aqueous HNO3 solution (1 M) at room temperature for 24 h (referred to as MOy/ex-Ca2Nb3O10/K+/H+).\n",

      "Several Cu(I)-containing mixed-metal oxides are reported to exist in the Cu2O-M2O5 (M = Nb, Ta) system that cannot be synthesized using conventional solid-state methods. For example, the synthesis of Cu2Nb8O21, a metastable p-type semiconductor, was prepared in high purity by the reaction of Cu2O and Nb2O5 nanoparticles within a CuCl flux using a 10:1 flux-to-reactant molar ratio. The CuCl flux solvent was preferentially utilized in these reactions owing to its low melting point, ability to solubilize Cu2O, and the common Cu(I) cations as that of the Cu2O reagent. The reaction mixture was heated in an evacuated fused-silica ampoule at 550 °C for 24 h that was immediately quenched. The Cu2Nb8O21 phase does not form in the absence of a molten flux at lower temperatures of 550 °C. At a higher reaction temperature of 650 °C the Cu2Nb8O21 compound begins to transform into CuNb3O8, and after the temperature reaches 750 °C, the Cu2Nb8O21 compound has completely transformed into CuNb3O8. In the Cu2O-Ta2O5 system, the Cu2Ta4O11 and Cu7Ta15O41 phases have not been reported to have been synthesized in high purity, but instead have been found as side products at reaction temperatures ranging from 700 °C to 1000 °C. Both the Cu2Ta4O11 and Cu7Ta15O41 phases have been calculated to have 33% and 22% vacancies on the copper-site positions within the unit cell, respectively. The Cu2Ta4O11 phase has been reported to be stabilized through doping with zirconium and by utilizing solid solutions such as Cu2-xNaxTa4O11. These Cu(I)-containing mixed-metal oxides exhibit band gaps deep within the visible-light energy range, spanning from ~1.3 eV to ~2.6 eV, and have shown high cathodic photocurrents for water reduction under visible-light in the form of polycrystalline photoelectrodes. Thus, the preparation of new Cu(I)-oxides in high purity can be facilitated with the use of a flux-mediated synthetic route in combination with binary-oxide nanoparticle precursors.\n",

Firstly, the Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, In(NO3)3⋅4.5H2O, and Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O with the stoichiometric amounts were dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, the citric acid, as a complexation agent, was added with the molar ratio (3:2) of citric acid to metal ions. After the pH value of the solution was adjusted to be 7 by adding appropriate ammonia water, the stoichiometric amount of Ta2O5 was added. Thirdly, the solution added with Ta2O5 was stirred continuously during heating to evaporate water until it was changed into viscous gel and finally ignited to flame, which resulted in the formation of some white ashes. Finally, the BCITY powder was obtained by calcining the white ashes at 1000\\u202f°C for 5\\u202fh in air.

The starting materials of Bi(NO3)3 and KCl (1:1 molar ratio) were mixed together, and then 60 mL of distilled water was added. White precipitate appeared immediately and was stirred for 5 h to complete the precipitation reaction. The precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water thoroughly and dried at 80 °C in air. The final BiOCl powder was obtained as seen from XRD patterns (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). In what followed, BiOCl and Ca(NO3)2 (1:1 molar ratio) were used to synthesize CaBiO2Cl by a solid-state reaction. The reactant powders were thoroughly ground together into a homogeneous mixture using a mortar and pestle, transferred to an alumina crucible, and subsequently heated in air at different temperatures for 12 h. A pale yellow polycrystalline powder (CaBiO2Cl) was obtained from the reactions. TiO2-xNx known for its good photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of pollutants under visible-light irradiation, was also prepared as a reference.\n",
