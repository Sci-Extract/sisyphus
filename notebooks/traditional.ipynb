      "Effect of Initial Grain Size on Deformation Mechanism during High‐Pressure Torsion in V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 High‐Entropy Alloy\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "The transition of the deformation mechanism from the dislocation slip-mediated mechanism to the twin-mediated mechanism with increasing grain size is a well-observed phenomenon in materials with low stacking fault energy during compression/tensile tests. To understand this effect further at large strains, a V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) high-entropy alloy with two initial average grain sizes is processed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) at different numbers of turns. The results indicate that initial grain size plays a significant role in the deformation mechanism during the HPT process. The fine-grained (FG) sample exhibits only a tangled dislocation structure, whereas mechanical twins are observed along with the formation of dislocations in the coarse-grained (CG) sample after the one-fourth turn. High dislocation density is observed in the CG sample after the one-fourth and first turn, which leads to a higher rate of hardness increment as compared with the FG sample. However, a similar microstructure and mechanical properties are observed after five turns of HPT processing in both FG and CG samples. After five turns, the microstructure consists of nanograins (average grain size ≈30 nm) with nanotwins, and the samples exhibit a very high ultimate tensile strength of ≈2 GPa with a reasonable elongation to failure of ≈6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are established as emerging advanced materials with outstanding properties because of their unique alloy design strategy.. The HEAs are designed with multiprinciple elements (at least five), each in the range of 5-35 at%.. Intriguingly, the mixing of numerous metallic elements in several HEAs leads to the formation of simple structures with exceptional properties. HEAs, depending on their composition, exhibit unique mechanical properties, such as high strength-ductility synergy, high strength at high temperatures, and superior damage tolerance at cryogenic temperature.-\n",
      "Recently, mechanical behavior at cryogenic temperature has been investigated widely in single face-centered cubic (FCC) HEAs due to its superior cryogenic tensile strength and high ductility. In most of these studies, superior cryogenic properties are primarily attributed to the low stacking fault energy (SFE) and the evolution of mechanical twins.. These mechanical twinning can impede the dislocation slip by decreasing the dislocation mean free paths through the dynamic Hall-Petch effect and also enhance the strain hardening rate by increasing the dislocation storage capacity, leading to enhanced mechanical properties. It is well known that the formation of mechanical twinning leads to twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effect in low SFE materials, such as high Mn steels..\n",
      "Very recently, we demonstrated the transition in deformation mechanism from dislocation slip to mechanical twinning with an increase in grain size in the V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 HEA during room temperature tensile deformation. Though the effect of initial grain size on the mechanical twinning is well established in the low SFE materials and conventional alloys, there are few studies regarding this topic in the multicomponent alloys where the applied strain on the material is low, and the deformation mechanism behavior at large strain is rather limited in the HEAs literature..\n",
      "High-pressure torsion (HPT), one of the severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques, is a well-known technique to apply a high amount of plastic strain to materials. We et al. studied the microstructural changes in the FeCoCrNi HEA during HPT processing at different strain levels. They suggested that the onset of mechanical twinning plays a vital role in grain refinement during the SPD process. Several reports have characterized the influence of SPD processing on grain refinement in HEAs;- however, there is no systematic research available on the effect of initial grain size on the deformation mechanism during SPD processing in HEAs. Motivated by this gap in the literature, we investigated the effect of initial grain size on the deformation mechanism in the V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 HEA during the HPT process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Experimental Section\n",
      "The HEA with a nominal composition of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) was fabricated using vacuum induction melting furnace using pure elements of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (purity >99.9%). The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm).\n",
      "A synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out at the Pohang Steel and Iron Corporation beamline for phase characterization and estimation of dislocation density. The XRD analysis was conducted with a resolution of ΔE/E = 2 × 10-4, 2θ from 30° to 100°, a step size of 0.02°, and a scan speed of 1° min-1 using monochromator filter. The dislocation density of samples was estimated from the XRD patterns by applying the \"convolution multiple whole profile\" (CMWP) method. An electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was conducted on the annealed sample (before HPT processing) with a step size of 50 nm in the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI XL30S). The TSL OIM Analysis 7 software was used to interpret the EBSD data. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was performed on the HPT-processed samples using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV (JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). The TEM samples were mechanically polished to a thickness of ≈60 μm, and electro-polishing with a solution containing 10% of HClO4 and 90% of CH3COOH was performed at room temperature using a voltage of 25 V.\n",
      "The miniature-tensile specimens (a gauge length of 1.5 mm, a gauge width of 1 mm, and a thickness of 0.7 mm) were cut from the HPT disc using electro-discharge machining. The tensile specimens were cut from the disk, such that a gauge length of 1.5 mm is located 2.5 mm away from the HPT disc center. Room temperature tensile tests were carried out at a quasi-static strain rate of 1 × 10-3 s-1 using a universal testing machine (Instron 1361, Instron Crop.. USA). The tensile samples were sprayed with black and white speckles on the specimen surface before tensile testing, and a digital image correlation method with an optical 3D deformation analysis (DIC; ARAMIS v6.1, GOM Optical Tech.) was used to measure the tensile strain. Vickers microhardness tests on the HPT samples were performed across the radial direction by applying a load of 500 g and a holding time of 10 s.\n",

      "3 Results\n",
      "3.1 Microstructural Characterization of Recrystallized Samples\n",
      "Figure presents the EBSD maps of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 HEA after annealing at 900 °C for 10 min (Figure a,b) and 1100 °C for 60 min (Figure c,d). Figure a,c shows inverse pole figure maps, and Figure b,d shows grain boundary maps. The Σ3 twin boundaries (TBs) and high-angle boundaries in grain boundary maps are shown by red and black colors, respectively. Both the annealed samples show completely recrystallized microstructure with abundant Σ3 boundaries. The samples annealed at 900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min resulted in microstructure with fine grains ( ≈ 3 μm) and coarse grains ( ≈ 60 μm), respectively. The average grain size is estimated using the EBSD analysis, without considering TBs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Microstructural Evolution during HPT Processing\n",
      "Figure shows the XRD patterns of fine-grained (FG) and coarse-grained (CG) samples before HPT processing (N = 0) and after five turns of HPT processing (N = 5). The XRD patterns of the annealed sample show a single FCC phase with no secondary phases, which confirms the thermodynamic calculations reported earlier for this HEA. The XRD patterns of HPT-processed samples also show a single FCC phase, indicating no evidence of phase transformation after HPT. Also, HPT processing leads to a significant peak broadening of XRD patterns, indicating grain refinement and lattice strain.\n",
      "The dislocation density was calculated using the CMWP method from the XRD patterns, and the results are plotted in Figure as a function of the number of HPT turns. The dislocation densities of the FG and CG samples at the initial annealed conditions (N = 0) are ≈5.5 × 1014 and ≈4.3 × 1014 m-2, respectively. A significant increment in the dislocation density occurs in both the FG and CG samples with increasing the number of turns during the HPT process. Intriguingly, the dislocation density increases continuously with increasing the number of HPT turns in the FG sample, but the dislocation density increases only up to one turn and then decreases in the CG sample. The dislocation density of the CG sample after 1/4 and 1 turns is remarkably higher than those of the FG sample. After five turns, the dislocation density reaches an almost similar value in both FG and CG samples.\n",
      "Figure shows the bright-field (BF) TEM images of the FG sample after 1/4 turn (Figure a) and 1 turn (Figure b) of HPT processing. The BF TEM image of the FG sample after 1/4 turn shows a high density of tangled dislocations (Figure a). The fact that accumulation of dislocations can occur within the grains could be because of the planar dislocation-slip modes.. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of Figure a shows only FCC phase diffraction spots (taken along [011] zone axis), confirming the presence of a single phase. The microstructure of the FG sample after one turn of HPT (Figure b) shows significant grain refinement with an average size of ≈100 nm. Correspondingly, the SAED pattern of one turn shows the concentric FCC ring pattern, indicating nanograins with high-angle grain boundaries. The strain contrast observed in nanograins can be related to the accumulation of dislocations.\n",
      "The TEM images of the CG sample after 1/4 turn and 1 turn of HPT processing are presented in Figure . In contrast to the FG sample, abundant mechanical twins are observed in the CG sample after 1/4 turn of HPT processing (Figure a-c). The thickness of mechanical twins is in the range of ≈10-50 nm, which is similar to the mechanical twins that are formed at cryogenic temperature reported earlier for the same HEA. The corresponding SAED pattern (shown in the inset of Figure a) shows additional diffraction spots, confirming the presence of mechanical twins in the CG sample. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image in Figure c shows the dislocation cell formation between mechanical twins (indicated by the yellow arrow), indicating dislocation storage ability of mechanical twins. The BF and dark-field (DF) TEM images of the CG sample after one turn of HPT processing are shown in Figure d,e, respectively. In Figure e, the black area indicated by the yellow dashed line is related to the trace of primary mechanical twins. It is apparent that an intensive density of dislocations is accumulated between the trace of mechanical twins (Figure e). It is interesting to note that the fraction of mechanical twins is relatively lower in 1 turn than 1/4 turn of the CG sample, and only the trace of primary mechanical twins is observed. The primary twins that are observed in 1/4 turn are parallel to each other, and the trace of primary twins that are observed in one turn is distorted due to the interaction of dislocation with primary twins.\n",
      "The TEM characterization of FG and CG samples after 1/4 turn and 1 turn indicates that the dominant deformation mechanism in the FG sample is dislocation slip, whereas the combination of dislocation slip and mechanical twinning acts as deformation mechanisms in the CG sample (N = 1/4 and 1). The formation of mechanical twins in the CG sample indicates that the local stress could exceed the critical twinning stress, whereas the local stress may not be high enough in the FG sample to overcome the required stress for twin initiation.\n",
      "The TEM images of FG and CG samples after five turns of HPT processing are shown in Figure . Unlike 1/4 and 1 turns, the microstructure of both samples shows similar microstructure after 5 turns. The microstructure consists of grains in nanoscale with an average grain size of ≈30 nm and ill-defined grain boundaries (Figure a,d). The SAED patterns show concentric rings, confirming the nanocrystalline nature of samples after five turns of HPT processing. The formation of nanograins with ill-defined grain boundaries (high-energy nonequilibrium boundaries) is a typically observed microstructure in materials subjected to SPD processing. Besides, the formation of nanotwins in few nanograins is also observed in both HPT-processed FG (Figure b) and CG (Figure e) samples. The high-resolution (HR)-TEM images taken from the area marked by yellow dashes in Figure b,e are presented in Figure c,f, respectively. These images reveal a series of parallel nanoscale mechanical twins with a thickness of 1-2 nm. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT)-generated SAED patterns (taken from the area indicated by red dashes) confirm the formation of nanotwins. The interaction between two sets of nanotwins is also observed (shown by red arrows in Figure f).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 Mechanical Properties\n",
      "The engineering stress versus strain curves of the FG and CG samples before and after HPT processing at different turns (1/4, 1, and 5 turns) are shown in Figure . The tensile curves indicate that samples in annealed condition exhibit low yield strength (YS) and high elongation to failure, whereas the HPT processing led to an enhancement in YS accompanied by a reduction in the elongation to failure. The strength-ductility trade-off is in agreement with the classic mechanical response of ultra-fine grained (UFG) metallic materials processed by SPD techniques. Table summarizes the relative data for the engineering YS, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and total elongation to failure (δ) for both the FG and CG samples. The CG sample in annealed condition shows a YS of ≈230 MPa, and the FG sample shows a relatively higher YS of ≈430 MPa. The higher YS observed in the FG sample can be attributed to the Hall-Petch strengthening effect. The UTSs of the FG and CG samples are 751 and 532 MPa, respectively, and the CG sample presents slightly higher total elongation to failure in comparison with the FG sample (CG ≈58% and FG ≈48%).\n",
      "After 1/4 turn of HPT processing, the UTS increases significantly for both FG ( ≈ 1.4 GPa) and CG ( ≈ 1.5 GPa) samples. The strength increases further with increasing the number of turns, and the increase in strength is accompanied by a decrease in total elongation to failure. After five turns, the tensile strength of FG and CG samples reached similar values ( ≈ 2 GPa) with a total elongation to failure of ≈6%. The CG sample presents relatively higher YS and UTS as compared with the FG sample after 1/4 turn and 1 turn of HPT. This indicates that the strength enhancement in the CG sample is higher than that of the FG sample, considering the initial strength of the FG and CG samples (before HPT).\n",

      "4 Discussion\n",
      "The results mentioned earlier indicate that the influence of initial grain size on the deformation mechanism during HPT is significant at 1/4 and 1 turns of HPT. The evolution of dislocation density with an increasing number of turns shows an interesting trend in CG samples. In this section, we discuss the possible reasons for the difference in the deformation mechanisms during the HPT process at 1/4 and 1 turns, dislocation density variation with the number of turns, and the mechanical properties.\n",
      "Microstructural evolution of the FG and CG samples during HPT processing is shown schematically in Figure a-d and Figure e-h, respectively. According to the TEM results of 1/4 turn samples (Figure and ), dislocation slip occurs as the main deformation mechanism in the FG sample (Figure b), whereas the plastic deformation is governed by both mechanical twinning and dislocation slip in the CG sample (Figure f). The critical resolved shear stress for dislocation slip and mechanical twinning can be expressed as Hall-Petch relationship (Equation and ). In most of the FCC-based materials, the strengthening coefficient of twinning (kT) is observed to be higher than the strengthening coefficient of slip (kS). As a result, the critical resolved shear for the formation of twinning increases with decreasing grain size. Consequently, the resolved shear stress could not exceed the critical twinning stress in the FG sample, and dislocation slip is observed to be the dominant deformation mechanism. However, in the CG sample, the resolved shear stress could overcome the required stress for twin initiation, and mechanical twinning occurred in the primary stage of deformation.. In addition, the dislocation density increases in both the samples after 1/4 turn of HPT processing, and the dislocation-dislocation interactions (Figure b) and dislocation-twin interactions (Figure f) occur in FG and CG samples, respectively.\n",
      "Significant grain refinement is observed after one turn of the FG sample (Figure b) as compared with the CG sample (Figure d). The trend of grain refinement in the FG sample follows the typical sequence of grain refinement using SPD techniques. First, the plastic deformation leads to the generation of high density of dislocations. Consequently, the dislocation walls and cell boundaries are formed from the accumulated regions of dislocations. With a continuous increase in applied strain, the cell boundaries are converted to low-angle boundaries and form subgrains (Figure c). Eventually, the high-angle boundaries are appeared by increasing the misorientation angle, leading to finer grain size (Figure d). However, the sequence of grain refinement in the CG sample is different from the FG sample. The grain refinement in the CG sample occurs by the formation of mechanical twins, accumulation of dislocations, formation of dislocation cell walls between the TBs (Figure g), and evolution of nanograins (Figure h). Increasing the number of turns from 1/4 to 1 turn, the accumulation of dislocations between the twin regions can occur and form subgrain boundaries (Figure g). Further increasing the number of turns (from 1 turn to 5 turns), the low-angle and high-angle boundaries are formed and grain refinement occurs in the matrix, which results in the formation of nano-grained microstructures (Figure h). Similar HPT-induced grain refinement mechanism was also reported in the FeCoCrNi HEA and Cu-30 wt% Zn alloy.. Another striking feature is detwinning in the CG sample after one turn. The number of mechanical twins is relatively higher in the CG sample after 1/4 turn than 1 turn, indicating the detwinning process. In several FCC materials, the detwinning process is reported and it is explained based on the interaction of dislocations with coherent TBs, leading to the formation of incoherent TBs.. On further straining, the interaction of dislocations with incoherent TBs can lead to detwinning. The detwinning process leads to the generation of dislocation walls of low-angle grain boundaries, and this low-angle grain boundary becomes high-angle grain boundary by increasing the misorientation angle with further increasing the number of turns.\n",
      "After 1/4 turn and 1 turn of HPT processing, relatively higher dislocation density is observed in the CG sample as compared with the FG sample. This can be explained based on the dislocation activity and mechanical twins. The presence of mechanical twins in the CG sample can store more dislocation as compared with the microstructure without mechanical twins.. In addition, the dislocation activity will be relatively lower in the nano-grained structure than the relatively coarser grains. As the grain size in the FG sample after one turn is ≈100 nm, it is possible that the dislocation activity is lower in the FG sample than the CG sample after one turn.\n",
      "The dislocation density in the FG sample increases continuously with increasing the number of turns, which is a common behavior in FCC materials where the plasticity is controlled only by the dislocation activities. In contrast, the dislocation density in the CG sample decreases after reaching a maximum value of ≈1.2 × 1016 m-2 at N = 1 turn. Similar decreasing behavior in the dislocation density after saturation in the CG sample was also observed in conventional FCC metals processed by SPD. The decrease in dislocation density can be attributed to the dislocation saturation limit during the SPD process. The dislocation density value of CG at 1/4 turn and 1 turn might be higher than the saturation dislocation density that can be accommodated in nanograins after 5 turns in the CG sample. As a result, the dislocation density decreases after 5 turns to reach the saturated dislocation density value in the CG sample, whereas it increases in the FG sample to reach the saturation dislocation density because the dislocation density in the FG sample after 1/4 turn and 1 turn is relatively lower than the CG sample. In addition, the processes of detwinning due to the interaction of dislocation with incoherent TBs can reduce the dislocation storage capability and lead to a decrease in dislocation density. In both the samples, the formation of nanotwins is observed after five turns of HPT. The formation of nanotwins in nanocrystalline copper is also reported as the major deformation mechanism during HPT at room temperature.. It is suggested that the nanoscale mechanical twin nucleates in grain interiors by overlapping of partial dislocations and stacking faults.. By increasing the strain, the nuclei of a nanoscale twin can grow up with the addition of partial dislocations onto the TBs..\n",
      "The strength enhancement in the CG sample in the primary stages of deformation can be attributed to the high density of dislocations and generation of mechanical twins. In the CG sample, the mechanical twins are formed at the initial stage of deformation (1/4 turn), and the formation of twins results in inducing additional interfaces in grain interior. It would efficiently decrease the dislocation-free path and lead to strengthening due to dislocation accumulation at the interface of twin and matrix. Also, it is important to note that the equilibrium microstructure obtained after five turns of HPT processing is independent of the initial grain size. However, the microstructural evolution to reach the final nanocrystalline structure is clearly dominated by the initial grain size. As it is schematically represented in Figure , two different SPD-induced grain refinement trends are observed in the FG and CG samples. As the final microstructure becomes similar after five turns, both the samples showed almost similar high ultimate strength value of ≈2 GPa with a reasonable elongation to failure of ≈6%. These outstanding mechanical properties can be attributed to the presence of nanograins and nanotwins, which improves the strength of HEA by impeding the dislocation motion.\n",

      "5 Conclusions\n",
      "In this work, the V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) HEA with two different initial grain sizes (FG sample ≈3 μm and CG sample ≈60 μm) were subjected to the HPT process at different numbers of turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5 turns), and their microstructural evolutions were investigated during the HPT process. The results can be summarized as follows. 1) The detailed microstructural characterization of HPT-processed samples clearly indicates the dependence of the deformation mechanism on the initial grain size at 1/4 turn and 1 turn. After five turns, both the samples presented similar microstructures containing nanograins, along with nanotwins in few grains. 2) Grain refinement occurs in the FG sample by the accumulation of dislocations, dislocation cell formation, low-angle grain boundary formation, and, finally, high-angle grain boundaries formation. In the CG sample, the grain refinement occurs by the formation of mechanical twins, dislocation cell formation between mechanical twins, detwinning due to dislocation interaction, low-angle grain boundaries, and, finally, high-angle grain boundaries. 3) Dislocation activity acts as a deformation mechanism in the FG sample, whereas mechanical twin acts as a deformation mechanism in the CG sample at low number of turns. 4) High dislocation density was observed at 1/4 turn and 1 turn in the CG sample than the FG sample due to high dislocation storage capacity of mechanical twins and also reduced dislocation activity due to the formation of nanograins in the FG sample after 1 turn. 5) Significant grain refinement (an average grain size of ≈30 nm after five turns) occurred after HPT processing of the FG and CG samples. Both the FG and CG samples exhibited a high hardness of ≈505 HV and a high UTS of ≈2 GPa with a reasonable elongation to failure of ≈6%.\n",

    "paper = 'The excellent ductility is mainly attributed to the formation of twinning during plastic deformation, as shown in Fig. 6b and e. As reported by Laplanche et al. [42], the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for twinning in CoCrNi was 260 ± 30 MPa, which was further verified by the modified Peierls-Nabarro (P-N) twinning nucleation model [55]. Furthermore, the true tensile stress for twinning onset was estimated to be ~790 MPa for the recrystallized CoCrNi [42]. Regardless of the effect of grain size, the twinning onset true strain for LAAMed CoCrNi in the present study is estimated to be ~7.6 % at a true stress of 790 MPa in the true stress-strain curve (Fig. 4b), which is lower than that for recrystallized one ( ~ 9.7 % [42]). Hence, twinning is able to be activated earlier in the LAAMed CoCrNi compared with the recrystallized one. Along with the formation of twinning, the deformation process is accompanied by the interactions between the heterogeneous structures mentioned earlier and twinning boundaries. For example, the interactions between dislocations (in slip bands) and twinning boundaries is clearly revealed in Fig. 6e. Moreover, the twinning boundaries penetrating across the cellular boundaries (Fig. 6e, g, h) are expected to subdivide the cellular structures, further promoting the interactions between the initial dislocations with twinning and cellular boundaries. In this case, steady WHR (Fig. 4b) is guaranteed by the dynamic Hall-Petch effect as that in TWIP steels [51]. Hence, non-uniform deformation (necking) is postponed with better ductility obtained. In addition, some other deformation mechanisms, such as the regional deformation induced FCC to HCP transformation [56], also can play important roles in the excellent mechanical behavior, which deserves further investigation for the LAAMed CoCrNi MEA in future work.'\n",
