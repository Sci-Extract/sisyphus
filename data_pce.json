    "text":"Due to the strong self-assembly of nonfullerene acceptor Y6, \nrealizing high performance in the Y6-based OSCs heavily relies \non the selection of processing solvent with low boiling point \n(e.g., chloroform), which can prevent the over aggregation of Y6 \nduring the film formation. Otherwise, using high boiling point \nsolvent (e.g., chlorobenzene and o-xylene) to build the devices \ngenerally results in poor photovoltaic performance because of \nthe excessive self-assembly aggregation of Y6.[18,27] The conven\ntional solvent additive treatments show limited effect on regu\nlating the morphology of Y6-based blend casting from high \nboiling point solvents. We then examine the advantage of the \nCN and DTT dual additives treatment for the OSCs processed \nby the high boiling point solvents. Relative to the lower PCE of \n13.23% obtained in the control PM6:Y6-based device processed \nby chlorobenzene with CN additive, a much higher PCE of \n15.85% was achieved by applying the dual additives of CN and \nDTT to treat the blend, along with significantly improved FF \nof 77.0% (Table 1 and Figure 2a). Particularly, such dual addi\ntives treatment showed encouraging effect on regulating the \nmorphology of the nonhalogen-solvent o-xylene-processed \nPM6:Y6 blend, recording an impressive PCE of 16.16% and a \nFF of 76.2% (Table 1 and Figure 2b).

    "text":" It is noteworthy that the synergistic effect of CN and DTT \ndual additives treatment effectively led to significantly improved \nFF values and increased PCEs of the OSCs (Figure 6c,d).  \nParticularly, FF values exceeding 80% should be a rarity in the \nreported OSCs.[35,36] According to the evaluation of the exciton \ncharge dissociation and charge recombination properties  \nin these devices (as shown in Figures S7 and S8, Supporting \nInformation), the dual additives treatment of CN and DTT \nfavors to improve their charge extraction efficiency and \nsuppress the charge recombination as compared to the conventional CN additive treatment, which are consistent \nwith the results observed in the PM6:Y6 system. Similar to \nthe PM6:Y6 blend, the PTQ10:DTT showed obviously higher \n\u03c7 parameter of 1.087 than that of 0.017 for the Y6:DTT blend \nand 0.432 for the m-BTP-PhC6:DTT blend (as shown in Figure \nS5, Supporting Information), indicating the higher miscibility \nof DTT with nonfullerene acceptor (Y6\/m-BTP-PhC6) com\npared to the polymer donor PTQ10. Relative to the PTQ10:Y6 \nand PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 blend films treated with CN additive \nalone, better nanoscale phase separation with more favorable  aggregation was realized in the films processed with the dual \nadditives of CN and DTT (as shown in Figures S9 and S10, \nSupporting Information), suggesting that the additional DTT \nadditive effectively restricted the over self-assembling of the Y6 \nand m-BTP-PhC6 acceptors in the active layers. Relative to the \nCN additive treatment for the PTQ10:Y6 blend, the dual addi\ntives treatment of CN and DTT also enhanced the preferential \nface-on orientation and narrowed the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction distance \nalong the OOP direction (as shown in Figure S11, Supporting \nInformation), which agrees with the phenomenon observed \nin the PM6:Y6 system mentioned above.

Other than the \nY6-series-based systems, this morphology control approach \nalso showed positive effect on optimizing the morphology of \nPM6:IT-4F blend film.

    "text":" It is noteworthy that the synergistic effect of CN and DTT \ndual additives treatment effectively led to significantly improved \nFF values and increased PCEs of the OSCs (Figure 6c,d).  \nParticularly, FF values exceeding 80% should be a rarity in the \nreported OSCs.[35,36] According to the evaluation of the exciton \ncharge dissociation and charge recombination properties  \nin these devices (as shown in Figures S7 and S8, Supporting \nInformation), the dual additives treatment of CN and DTT \nfavors to improve their charge extraction efficiency and \nsuppress the charge recombination as compared to the conventional CN additive treatment, which are consistent \nwith the results observed in the PM6:Y6 system. Similar to \nthe PM6:Y6 blend, the PTQ10:DTT showed obviously higher \n\u03c7 parameter of 1.087 than that of 0.017 for the Y6:DTT blend \nand 0.432 for the m-BTP-PhC6:DTT blend (as shown in Figure \nS5, Supporting Information), indicating the higher miscibility \nof DTT with nonfullerene acceptor (Y6\/m-BTP-PhC6) com\npared to the polymer donor PTQ10. Relative to the PTQ10:Y6 \nand PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 blend films treated with CN additive \nalone, better nanoscale phase separation with more favorable  aggregation was realized in the films processed with the dual \nadditives of CN and DTT (as shown in Figures S9 and S10, \nSupporting Information), suggesting that the additional DTT \nadditive effectively restricted the over self-assembling of the Y6 \nand m-BTP-PhC6 acceptors in the active layers.
