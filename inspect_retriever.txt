In the present study, the carbon added by 0 at %, 0.5 at %, and 1.0 at % in cobalt-chromium-iron-manganese-nickel high entropy alloys were prepared by magnetic levitation melting technique with a high-purity nitrogen atmosphere to melt the cobalt, chromium, iron, manganese, nickel, and carbon elementary substances under 1650 °C for 25 min. The melting processes were repeated 4 times to attain homogeneous elemental distribution in the ingots. The cobalt-chromium-iron-manganese-nickel - (0, 0.5, and 1.0 at %) carbon ingots were solution treated at a temperature of 1100 °C for 2 hours and subsequently hot rolled with reduction of 50 % with speed of 70 m/s. Later, the rolled sheets were annealed at 800 °C for 40 min to obtain fully recrystallized microstructures. The detailed chemical composition of the prepared materials was measured by optical spectrometer analyzer, Table .
The heat-treated high entropy alloy samples were polished up to 2000# SiC paper and suspended diamond. After that, the polished samples were etched by 10 % Oxalic acid solution. The Keyence VHX-7000 stereo-optical microscope and EOL 7900F scanning electron microscope were adopted to analyze the effect of carbon addition on microstructural evolution and fracture mechanism. The microstructure of the annealed samples along the rolling direction and normal direction for the 0 carbon, 0.5 carbon, and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys exhibit equiaxed grains, both for the rolling direction and normal direction cross-sections after annealing treatment, Figure . In the meanwhile, the voids, observed along the grain boundaries, come from the dropped precipitates during polished and/or etching processes. Furthermore, the grain sizes of 0 carbon, 0.5 carbon, and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys are measured at 4.2 μm, 15.6 μm, and 10.62 μm, respectively. It is observed that the carbides precipitate along the grain boundary in 1.0 carbon high entropy alloy. Besides, a bi-model structure with a fine grain ( < 10 μm) and coarse grain (approximately 100 μm) is observed in 1.0 carbon high entropy alloy, indicating that the propagation of tensile and cupping cracks shall be different. In the previous studies -, the carbides were also detected in high carbon-containing ( > 1.0 at %) high entropy alloys with annealing temperatures between 600 °C and 1200 °C and time up to 14 hours . It thus appears that the type of carbides strongly depends on the carbon alloying and annealing treatment.
In addition, the phase composition of cobalt-chromium-iron-manganese-nickel -(0 at %, 0.5 at %, and 1.0 at %) carbon samples were detected by x-ray diffraction using a Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW diffractometer on Cu target using a 2θ range from 10° to 120°. The x-ray diffraction detection of the 0 carbon, 0.5 carbon, and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys illustrates that all three high entropy alloys exhibit face-centered cubic structures, Figure . This observation supports that the dissolved carbon atoms into the high entropy alloys matrix won't bring phase change after rolling process and annealing treatment .

The tensile curves of 0 carbon, 0.5 carbon, and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys samples, where the yield and tensile stress gradually increase with carbon content, while the 0.5 carbon high entropy alloy exhibits the highest uniform elongation, Figure . It shall be noted that the cobalt-chromium-iron-manganese-nickel high entropy alloy already exhibit remarkable work hardening capacity , . While, the mechanical properties of 0.5 carbon and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys are further improved contributed from carbon addition, where the product of strength and elongation of 0.5 carbon and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys are 33.8 GPa% and 36.3 GPa%, respectively. The outstanding mechanical properties are much higher than 0 carbon high entropy alloy with 23.5 GPa%. The cupping force and displacement of the 0.5 carbon high entropy alloy are higher than that of 0 carbon and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys, Figure . It shall be noted that adding 1.0 at % carbon significantly lowers the ductility compared with that of 0.5 carbon high entropy alloy sample.
The detailed scanning electron microscope and stereo-optical microscope observation of the tensile and cupping fractures of 0 carbon, 0.5 carbon, and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloy samples, Figure . It illustrates that a high density of dimples distributes on the tensile fracture of 0 carbon high entropy alloy sample, Figure . With increasing the carbon content, the micro-cracks appear along the grain boundaries in 0.5 carbon and 1.0 carbon high entropy alloys, Figure , c. A similar micro-cracks formation mechanism is also found in the 1.0 at % carbon containing high entropy alloy . Additionally, the precipitates are detected on the fracture of 1.0 carbon high entropy alloy, indicating that the fracture mechanism of 1.0 carbon high entropy alloy shall be different from that of 0 carbon and 0.5 carbon high entropy alloys. The complete view of the cupping fractures of 0 carbon, 0.5 carbon, and 1.0 carbon, Figure -f. The observed cracks in 0 carbon and 0.5 carbon samples are deep and long. In contrast, the cracks in 1.0 carbon samples are short and widely distributed on the cupped surface. Generally, the ductile fracture mechanism works during the cupping test of 0 carbon and 0.5 carbon high entropy alloys, where only a few cracks propagate on the sample surface. However, with an increase of carbon content to 1.0 at %, the cracks prefer to nucleate from more sites, showing brittle fracture characteristics.

It thus appears that the type of carbides strongly depends on the carbon alloying and annealing treatment.
In the present study, only part of the C elements in 1.0 carbon high entropy alloy reacts and forms carbides due to the lower annealing temperature and time, thus without being detected by x-ray diffraction. It seems that the carbides along the grain boundary shall deteriorate the plastic deformation of the investigated material. Thus, the mechanical properties of carbon-containing high entropy alloys are needed to be further investigated.

test parameter
The tensile and cupping tests were performed under the equipment of Zwick/Roell Z250 and GBC-60W, at room temperature, with a strain rate of 2 mm/min and a displacement rate of 5 mm/min, respectively. The tensile samples with a gauge length of 32 mm, a thickness of 1.5 mm, and a width of 8 mm, as well as the cupping sample with an area of 40×40 mm2 and a thickness of 1.5 mm were cut by an electrical discharge machine following with polished up to 2000# SiC paper.

experimental
The Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy was prepared by vacuum suspension melting in an argon atmosphere using high-purity metals Co, Cr, Fe, Ni and Mn ( > 99.9 wt.%). A 3 kg ingot (ϕ60 mm × 130 mm) was repeatedly melted seven times to eliminate compositional segregation (Fig. S2). The cast alloy was homogenized at 1200 °C for 24 h. The homogenized alloy was then cold rolled to plate form and annealed at 900 °C for 5 h. After that, the plate was cold rolled again to a thickness reduction of ~80% to 1.2 mm, annealed at 730, 780 and 820 °C for 10 min and then water quenched. The plate samples were designated RA-730, RA-780 and RA-820, respectively. Fig. S3 illustrates the thermomechanical processing of the alloy.
The crystal structures of the samples were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation. The microstructures of the alloys were examined using an optical microscope and an FEI Quanta 650F scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM is equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for chemical analysis and an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector for crystallographic analysis. EBSD samples were fabricated by mechanical polishing followed by electropolishing in an aqueous solution of HClO4:C2H5OH = 1:10 by volume at 20 V and -20 °C. An aberration-corrected FEI Titan Themis G2-300 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to analyze the microstructure and elemental distributions at the nano- and atomic levels. The TEM samples were first mechanically ground to a thickness of 30 μm and then electrolytically jet polished in an HClO4:C2H5OH = 1:10 electrolyte. The in situ deformation of the sample was performed using an in situ tensile TEM sample holder (Bestron-INSTEMS-M). The in situ TEM test sample was micromachined using a focused ion beam (FIB, FEI- Helios-NanoLab-600i).
Five thermodynamic parameters are used as empirical criteria to assure a single-phase FCC structure for the alloy: enthalpy of mixing ( Δ H m i x ), entropy of mixing ( Δ S m i x ), Ω (defined as T m Δ S m i x Δ H m i x ), atomic size difference ( δ ), and valence electron concentration ( V E C ). These parameters can be calculated by Eqs. (1-3) [36]: (1) { Ω = T m Δ S m i x Δ H m i x Δ H m i x = 4 ∑ i < j c i c j Δ H i j Δ S m i x = - R ∑ i = 1 n c i l n c i (2) { δ r = ∑ i = 1 n c i ( 1 - r i r ¯ ) 2 r ¯ = ∑ i = 1 n c i r i (3) V E C = ∑ i = 1 n c i ( V E C ) i where c i and c j are the mole fractions of elements i and j , Δ H i j is the enthalpy of mixing between elements i and j , R is the gas content (8.314 J/(mol K)), T m is the melting temperature of the alloy ( T m =1307 °C), which can be determined by thermodynamic calculation using JMatPro software, r i is the atomic radius of element i , r ¯ is the weighted average radius of the elements, and ( V E C ) i is the valence electron concentration of element i. The atomic radii and valence electron concentrations of the constituent elements of the alloy can be seen in Table S1 (Supplementary Information). Table S2 shows the enthalpy of mixing of the element pairs. For the Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy, the five parameters calculated are Δ S m i x =13.13 J/(k mol), Δ H m i x = -3.9 kJ/mol, Ω = 5.51, δ = 0.39%, and VEC = 8.0. All parameters are well within acceptable values for maintaining an FCC single-phase structure, which are 11-19.5 J/(k mol) for Δ S m i x , -15-5 kJ/mol for Δ H m i x , >1.1 for Ω , <6.6% for δ , and >8.0 for V E C [37-39].

Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the tensile properties ( σ y , σ U T S and ε f ) between Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy samples and other alloys. Figs. 4(a) and (b) show the comparison with some common engineering alloys. It is apparent that whereas the homogenized sample appeared to be comparable to the common engineering alloys, the heat-treated samples are clearly more superior in combined strength and ductility to all the comparison alloys, including TWIP/TRIP steels [45]. Figs. 4(c) and (d) show the comparison with other single-phase and dual-phase HEAs reported in the literature [17,46-52] (Supplementary Table S4 for detailed information). The homogenized sample may be considered of low performance relative to these comparison alloys, but the heat-treated samples, particularly the RA-780 sample, appear to outperform all the comparison alloys, including the ultrastrong and ductile coherent/incoherent L12/B2 precipitation-reinforced HEA, such as (CoCrFeNi)94Ti2Al4 [53], Al0.7Fe2Mn1.8Ni [54] and AlCrFe2Ni2 [55] HEAs.
Fig. 3 presents mechanical testing and analysis of the Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy. Fig. 3(a) shows the tensile engineering stress-strain curves of four samples after different heat treatments. The RA-730 sample showed the highest yield strength ( σ y = 1300 MPa), and the RA-820 sample showed the highest tensile elongation to failure ( ε f = 56%), but the RA-780 sample showed the best combination of strength and ductility, with a yield strength of 980 MPa and a ductility of 48% tensile elongation to failure. The RA-780 sample also exhibited the highest strain hardening effect among all the samples, with a strength increase of 405 MPa from the yield strength to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 1385 MPa.
A high strain hardening rate ( θ = d σ t r u e d ε t r u e ) is considered a primary reason for preventing necking to reach high strength and ductility [44]. Fig. 3(b) shows the true stress-true strain curves (the dashed curves) and the strain hardening rate versus true strain curves (the solid curves) for the four samples. It is seen that the RA-780 sample exhibited the highest strain hardening rate among all samples during the plastic yielding stage. It is also noted that for the RA-780 sample, θ > σ t r u e till 35% true strain. Fig. 3(c) shows DIC images of the von Mises strain maps of the RA-780 sample at two different stages during the deformation process. It is evident that the deformation was uniform within the gauge length. Fig. 3(d) shows an optical image of the ruptured RA-780 sample. It is evident that the sample experienced no necking till rupture. Fig. 3(e) displays two SEM images of the ruptured surface, revealing a typical dimpled morphology of plastic rupture.

Fig. 1 shows a microstructural analysis of the Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy. Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns of five samples, including the homogenized, cold-rolled, and the three annealed samples. All five patterns are indexed to the same single-phase FCC structure with a lattice parameter of 0.358 nm. Chemical analysis, as summarized in Table S3 (more information is presented in Figs. S4 and S5), indicated a uniform distribution of all elements and a composition close to the nominal. Fig. 1(b) shows the microstructure of the alloy after the homogenization treatment as an inverse pole figure crystal orientation map. The color code for the crystallographic directions is indicated in the inset. The homogenized sample had large grains with an average size of 300 μm. Fig. 1(c) shows the microstructure of the RA-730 sample. It is apparent that the sample had not recrystallized and that it had a dominant 〈110〉 preferential orientation in the plate normal direction. Fig. 1(d) shows the microstructure of the RA-780 sample. The sample was obviously recrystallized with two distinctive populations of grains of different sizes, with an average size of ~1 μm for the smaller grains and ~18 μm for the large grains. Fig. 1(e) shows the small grains in the sample at a higher magnification. Some twins are apparent (indicated by the black arrows). Fig. 1(f) shows the grain misorientation angle distribution of the sample. It is apparent that there is a high population of grains with a misorientation of 60°. They are annealing twins ( ∑ 3 ). It is clear that the number fraction of annealing twins is 25%. Fig. 1(g) is a kernel average misorientation map of the RA-780 sample. The large grains appear to have relatively larger kernel average misorientation angles of <3° than the smaller grains at <1°. The kernel average misorientation angle measures for the local lattice tilt, e.g.. caused by a dislocation defect, and thus is considered related to the dislocation density [43]. This observation suggests a higher dislocation density in the larger grains than in the smaller grains. Thus, the smaller grains are considered to be recrystallized grains, and larger grains are considered to be deformed grains. Fig. 1(h) shows the microstructure of the RA-820 sample. The sample is fully recrystallized with equiaxial grains of about 8 μm in average size. Some annealing twins are also obvious. Fig. 1(i) shows the grain misorientation angle distribution of the sample. The number population of annealing twins is ~40%.
Fig. 2 shows a TEM analysis of the microstructures of the Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy. Fig. 2(a) shows a series of bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM) images of the RA-780 sample. The sample contained small recrystallized grains (RG) and large deformed grains (DG). Fig. 2(b) shows a deformed grain at a higher magnification. The grain contained a high density of dislocations. The inset shows a selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) pattern. The pattern is indexed to a ( 111 ) [ 11 2 ¯ ] twin in the [ 1 ¯ 10 ] zone axis. These are deformation twins. They are generally thin plates of approximately ten nanometers in thickness and are difficult to reveal using the EBSD method; therefore, only annealing twins can be seen in Fig. 1(d). Fig. 2(c) shows an atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM image from the grain. A few stacking faults are present. Fig. 2(d) shows a recrystallized grain, and Fig. 2(e) shows a high-resolution image of the grain. The grain contained some partial dislocations. Fig. 2(f) shows a dark-field (DF)-TEM image of recrystallized grains. The annealing twins are several micrometers in thickness, distinctive from the much thinner deformation twin plates seen in Fig. 2(b).
Fig. 7 shows a TEM analysis of the microstructure of recrystallized grains in the RA-780 sample after deformation to 10% strain. Fig. 7(a) shows a STEM image of one recrystallized grain. The microstructure contained a high density of stacking faults on different {111} planes. Fig. 7(b) shows a HAADF-STEM image of the stacking faults. The stacking faults form into in situ network cells of ~50 nm across, much smaller than the average spacing ( ~ 800 nm) between the long-range columns of dislocations. Fig. 7(c) shows a high-resolution HAADF-STEM image of the stacking faults stemming from adjacent {111} planes, forming Lomer-Cottrell (L-C) locks. Fig. 7(d) shows the HAADF-STEM image of the Lomer-Cottrell and dislocation structures. It is clear that the blocked dislocation is a 1 / 2 [ 110 ] 60° full dislocation consisting of two partial dislocations and a stacking fault in between ( a 2 < 110 > → a 6 < 1 1 ¯ 2 ¯ > + SF + a 3 < 121 > ). Fig. 7(e) shows the lattice strain of the HAADF-STEM image, which is calculated in the horizontal directions using the peak pairs algorithm [63]. The obvious distribution of extension (pink) and compression (red) strain regions implies lattice differences. Fig. 7(f) shows the overlapping ε X X strain maps with the corresponding HAADF-STEM images. It is noted that the highest stress field localized around the Lomer-Cottrell lock, which is responsible for providing high lattice frictional stress for pinning dislocations [64].

test parameter
An Instron 5966 tensile tester was used to characterize the tensile mechanical properties of the alloys. Dog bone-shaped samples with a gauge section of 15 × 2.5 × 1.2 mm were cut from the plates. A constant strain rate of 1 × 10-3 s - 1 was used. The digital image correlation (DIC) method with the LaVision-DaVis data acquisition package was used to study the strain field upon tensile deformation.

NCATB (Fe-27.5Ni-17.5Co-10.5Al-2.2Ta-0.04B) (at.%) samples were produced by arc-melting a mixture high purity of raw materials (over 99.9 wt.%) in an argon atmosphere (Ti as getter for residual oxygen). The following detailed heat-treatment steps are described in our previous article [27] with additional aging (600 °C, 2-5 h). Tensile test samples with a gauge length of 20 mm and a cross-section of 2.4 × 0.5 (mm2) were produced by EDM. Before tension test at room temperature, samples were carefully ground and polished to a mirror surface with SiC papers and suspension solutions. In order to measure back-stress, additional loading-unloading-reloading (LUR) cyclic tension tests were conducted. The strain rate is set up as 5 × 10-4/s.
The microstructure and grain orientation of the NCATB samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Apreo) equipped with an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detector (Oxford Instruments, Symmetry). Detailed procedures for grain size statistics and particle fraction measurements are described in Ref. [27]. A JEOL2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM), operated at 200 kV, was used for further phase (martensite and γ') identification and dislocation detection. The composition of γ' particles was detected using an FEI Talos F200X S/TEM equipped with Super-X EDS (also operated at 200 kV). Thin-foils for TEM detection were prepared by being mechanically ground to 0.10 mm and subsequently thinned to electron-transparent with Gatan (PIPS II) Precise Ion Polishing System.

In Fig. 2d, we compare three groups of systems, including hetero-structure metals (labelled with stars), some TRIP/dual phase/maraging steels (labelled with solid circles), homogeneous HEAs (including precipitation-strengthened HEAs - labelled with "*"), and our heterogeneous lamella structured HEAs in a UTS versus total elongation plot [40-51]. Most metallic materials in the first two groups suffer from the classic strength-ductility trade-off. When compared with these counterparts, our HL-NCATB samples show much better tension properties through microstructure control and metastability engineering, especially the ones via the aging process. More importantly, the current thermomechanical processing methods for fabricating aged HL-NCATB samples may be amenable for current industry production standards, especially for existing ironmaking and steelmaking plants. In the following section, macroscopic tensile tests, microscopic EBSD detection, submicroscopic TEM observation are discussed to provide insight into the underlying deformation mechanisms of the aged HL-NCATB specimens with increasing strains, which are responsible for their exceptional tensile properties.
The tensile behavior of HL-NCATB before and after aging are presented in Fig. 2 a. In the engineering stress-strain curves of NCATB specimens, NCATB-2 can attain an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of ~1.4 GPa with total elongation strain of ~ 30%, which gives the best combination of strength and ductility. SEM micrographs of the tensile fracture surfaces of NCATB-2 are presented in Fig. 2b and c, which exhibit clear evidence of transgranular ductile fracture. The selected areas with higher magnification show that the fracture surface of this sample is slanted at roughly 45° to the tensile direction, which is related to the plane of maximum shear stress and contains ductile microvoids. On the other hand, NCATB-5 shows a yield strength of ~1.1 GPa and an ultrahigh UTS of ~1.7 GPa with fracture elongation over 10%. The related SEM micrographs for the tensile fracture surfaces of NCATB-5 are presented in Supplementary Fig. S3, which also show transgranular fracture but contain larger ductile microvoids. In comparison with another solutionized NCATB specimen (annealed at 1050 °C for 30 min, composed of ultrafine grains + fine grains, UTS ~1.05 GPa, fracture elongation ~23%, microstructure presented in Supplementary Fig. S1) showing the highest UTS in our previous study [27], the NCATB-2 sample shows ~25% increase both in UTS and total elongation. Considering the solvus temperature of γ′ precipitates in the current matrix is over 950 °C [38,39], both NCATB-2 and NCATB-5 may lead to interesting intermediate temperature applications, depending on other features, such as precipitates and grain boundary stability.
Microstructure characterization of the NCATB-0 specimen with unique heterogeneous lamellar (HL) structure reveals microstructural features across multiple length scales, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The HL structure contains fine grains and coarse grains over a large length scale. The other fine scale HL structure contains ultrafine grains and fine grains, as seen in Supplementary Fig. S1. Related information regarding grain size in HL-NCATB samples is included in Table S1. The volume fraction of precipitated NiAl-B2 particles along grain boundaries increases with aging time, as shown in Table 1 . The formation of lamella bands, shear bands and microbands with high-/low- angle boundaries, and Zener's pinning effect caused by the precipitation of NiAl-B2 particles, are responsible for the formation of HL structure, which has already been demonstrated and confirmed in our previous study [27]. The appearance of HL structure is considered to be caused by a significant difference in grain growth rates between shear bands with high-angle boundaries and lamella bands with low-angle boundaries.

Further microstructure characterization reveals that nano-scale γ' precipitates are formed in the FCC matrix of NCATB-2, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. HRTEM micrographs in Fig. 1d show that γ' particles with L12 superlattice structure are highly coherent with the FCC matrix in NCATB-5, and the misfit between γ' and the matrix is 0.17%. The size and volume fraction of γ' precipitates in HL-NCATB samples under different aging conditions are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2. The EDS line-scan result in Fig. 1e and f shows that Ni, Al, and Ta are enriched in γ' precipitates, which confirms that Ta is a strong γ' former. In the current study, Ta is chosen instead of Ti as the γ' former to avoid the precipitation of η (Ni3Ti) phase along the grain boundaries [37].

The HEA with a nominal composition of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) was fabricated using vacuum induction melting furnace using pure elements of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (purity >99.9%). The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm).
The CoCuFeMnNi alloy was obtained by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) of pure raw materials under low-pressure pure Ar atmosphere (450 mbar). The obtained buttons were remelted 6 times inside water-cooled copper crucible to ensure compositional homogeneity. Thereafter, the alloy was cold pressed to improve its workability and finally cold rolled into 1 mm thick laminas (90% cold work). The obtained samples were solution treated under Ar atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h and quenched in water. Such temperature was selected to obtain a single phase FCC microstructure: in fact, available CALPHAD simulations indicate that at 1000 °C the alloy falls well within a single FCC phase field. [, ]
Microstructural characterization was performed at different length scales by optical microscopy (Leitz Aristomet) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Zeiss Gemini, equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, EDS, probe) on polished cross sections, etched with Nital 2% reagent. Moreover, X-Ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X'PertPro, wavelength = 15 418 Å) was performed to identify the present phases. Mechanical behavior of the BM and of the welded beads was characterized by means of Vickers microhardness profiles (Future Tech Corp. FM-700 indenter, applying a 100 gf load for 15 s) and uniaxial tensile tests at ambient temperature: tests were conducted according to ASTM E8/E8M-09 standard on sub-size specimens by means of an MTS Alliance RT/100 universal testing machine. Tensile specimens were 100 mm long and 1 mm thick, with a reduced section measuring 32 mm × 4 mm × 1 mm; the welded bead lied perpendicular to the specimen's main axis.

mechanical
Mechanical behavior of the base and the welded alloy was assessed in tensile conditions, resulting in the stress - strain curves, reported in Figure . It is immediately evident that the mechanical response in both conditions was extremely similar. All samples were characterized by an elastic modulus of 146 GPa; yielding took place at 259.4 ± 2,3 MPa in the BM and was almost negligibly decreased to 255.9 ± 3.5 MPa after welding; finally, the ultimate tensile strength was found to be 580.3 ± 4,1 MPa and 576.4 ± 1,6 MPa in base and welded conditions, respectively. Failure happened at a deformation of 28.3 ± 0.4% in the BM and at 29.0 ± 0.2% after welding. It shall be strongly underlined that, as shown in Figure , failure of welded samples did not take place inside the welded bead nor in the HAZ, but rather in the BM. As a consequence, fracture surfaces, which lied at 45° with respect to the loading direction, were homogeneous in both base and welded samples (Figure ): their morphology is characterized by rather deep dimples and shows no cleavage planes, confirming that a ductile failure of the tensile samples took place after considerable elongation. The fact that failure has never taken place in the welded bead confirms the results of hardness tests (Figure ), which showed that mechanical resistance is locally improved in the welded bead, probably due to solidification-induced stresses and the emergence of the second Cu-rich phase. Moreover, tensile tests allow confirming the extreme soundness of the obtained joint, as no critical defect was induced. This suggests that laser beam welding may be used to process the high entropy alloy at hand in the view of structural applications, as the mechanical resistance and the ductility offered by the joint are equivalent to the ones characterizing the annealed material.
The matrix phase, constituting approximately the 66.1 wt% of the welded bead, is characterized by a lattice parameter d(111) = 3.618 Å; conversely, the Cu-rich interdendritic phase shows a larger lattice parameter d(111) = 3.643 Å and constitutes the 33.9 wt% of the observed microstructure. The existence of these two distinct FCC phases, a Cu-rich and a Cu-lean one, has already been described for a cast CoCuFeMnNi alloy, albeit on a larger scale,[] and is also confirmed by available CALPHAD predictions. [] Moreover, similar Cu enrichments of the interdendritic areas leading to a second FCC phase have been reported in a welded CoCrCuFeNi alloy, too. [] As a matter of fact, Cu appears highly prone to segregate from other elements in both the disordered solid solution and the liquid phase. In the solid state, its interaction with other alloying elements is determined by the large and positive mixing enthalpy values of each alloying pair (6 KJ mol-1 with Co, 13 KJ mol-1 with Fe, and 4 KJ mol-1 with Mn and Ni[]). Moreover, the study of binary Fe-Cu and ternary Co-Fe-Cu systems has shown the presence of a submerged miscibility gap, which drives the phase separation of Cu-rich/Cu-poor phases in the liquid state, too. [, ] On the contrary, Ni has shown very little tendency to segregation from the liquid in similar HEAs, as its partition coefficient is close to unity. [] No preferential texturing of the welded bead appears to have been induced by the directional solidification, as the relative intensities of different reflections in XRD diffractograms are the same as in the BM.
Figure reports a general view, showing how the microstructure of plates welded with optimal parameters evolves across the MZ, HAZ, and BM. The MZ presents a dendritic structure, whereas small, equiaxed grains can be found in both the HAZ (evidenced by the different colors induced by the chemical etching) and in the BM. Such microstructural evolution is strictly related to the trend shown by the hardness profile in Figure . Both microstructural examination and hardness trend suggest that the welded bead is 1180 μm large on its top and becomes relatively thinner in its center, at ≈650 μm, displaying an average hardness of 187.8 HV. Outside the MZ, the continuous hardness decrease from about 185 to 160 HV suggesting that a limited HAZ can be found, spanning 300 μm on each side of the central bead. Finally, the hardness trend becomes essentially flat, indicating that the heat propagating from the central bead could not induce significative material evolution outside the previously described areas. In fact, an average and roughly constant hardness of 162.5 HV was found to characterize the BM. The improved hardness of the MZ can be readily attributed to the stresses arising from the rapid solidification and the biphasic microstructure, which will be discussed in greater detail in the next paragraphs. Similarly, the hardening of the HAZ shall be related to the formation or growth of second phases triggered by the heat diffusing from the melted area.

phase
The matrix phase, constituting approximately the 66.1 wt% of the welded bead, is characterized by a lattice parameter d(111) = 3.618 Å; conversely, the Cu-rich interdendritic phase shows a larger lattice parameter d(111) = 3.643 Å and constitutes the 33.9 wt% of the observed microstructure. The existence of these two distinct FCC phases, a Cu-rich and a Cu-lean one, has already been described for a cast CoCuFeMnNi alloy, albeit on a larger scale,[] and is also confirmed by available CALPHAD predictions. [] Moreover, similar Cu enrichments of the interdendritic areas leading to a second FCC phase have been reported in a welded CoCrCuFeNi alloy, too. [] As a matter of fact, Cu appears highly prone to segregate from other elements in both the disordered solid solution and the liquid phase. In the solid state, its interaction with other alloying elements is determined by the large and positive mixing enthalpy values of each alloying pair (6 KJ mol-1 with Co, 13 KJ mol-1 with Fe, and 4 KJ mol-1 with Mn and Ni[]). Moreover, the study of binary Fe-Cu and ternary Co-Fe-Cu systems has shown the presence of a submerged miscibility gap, which drives the phase separation of Cu-rich/Cu-poor phases in the liquid state, too. [, ] On the contrary, Ni has shown very little tendency to segregation from the liquid in similar HEAs, as its partition coefficient is close to unity. [] No preferential texturing of the welded bead appears to have been induced by the directional solidification, as the relative intensities of different reflections in XRD diffractograms are the same as in the BM.
To rationalize the observed evolution of hardness across the welded bead, a finer microstructural analysis of the different areas was performed at both the micro-scale (Figure ) and the nanoscale (Figure ). The microstructure of the MZ presents a dendritic structure, mainly oriented along the highest temperature gradients, i.e.. from the center of the welded bead to its borders (Figure ). Such structure is organized in fairly large, nonequiaxial grains featuring an average length of 41 μm and a thickness of 30 μm. Such grains are organized in a columnar structure, with their long axis lying perpendicular to the bead. Similar grain morphologies are common in several welded alloys[, ] and stem from the rapid heat transfer taking place towards the base metal during initial solidification. [] As shown in Table , EDS analyses revealed that the chemical composition of dendritic branches is close to the intended equiatomic one, although it appears to be slightly Cu-poor. Conversely, interdendritic areas display a strong enrichment in Cu and, more limitedly, Mn and a distinct decrease in Fe and Co concentration. Ni content appears to be constant through both the observed phases. Such compositional separation originated from two properly separated phases, as confirmed by the XRD diffractograms reported in Figure : whereas the BM is characterized by the presence of a single set of peaks referring to an FCC phase, an evident splitting of all the peaks can be noticed in the MZ. The appearance of humps lying at lower angle values with respect to the main ones evidences the formation of a second phase with the same crystal structure but larger lattice spacing: this difference is justified by the observed Cu enrichment, as Cu is the largest atom among the considered ones.
Finally, the BM (Figure ) shows the typical microstructure of a recrystallized material, being characterized by a uniform distribution of equiaxed grains of the main FCC phase, with no second phases at the grain boundary. At a finer length scale, the grain interior of the main FCC phase appears to be decorated by extremely numerous, nanometric, spherical particles. Such particles have been earlier demonstrated to consist of Cu-rich atomic clusters, exhibiting FCC structure and full coherency with respect to the surrounding matrix, without any detectable difference in lattice parameter. [] Such spherical clusters could be found in the dendrite interior of MZ and inside grains of both HAZ and BM. Their average size appears to be slightly larger in the HAZ than in BM, suggesting that the heat flowing from the MZ likely caused a more extensive rearrangement of Cu atoms in the HAZ, therefore leading to the formation of larger clusters. This observation allows concluding that the HAZ is actually composed of two layers, which are characterized by different microstructures. The initial area, roughly 50 μm thick and lying next to the MZ border, experienced a stronger thermal effect, which lead to the formation of the grain boundaries of the Cu-rich FCC phase described by Sonkusare et al. [] The remaining part of the HAZ, up to 300 μm from the MZ border, likely underwent less serious heating and, as a consequence, does not show any grain boundary decoration but is mainly characterized by a limited growth of the nanometric clusters, which in turn induced an evident hardness increase with respect to the BM.

The HEA with a nominal composition of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) was fabricated using vacuum induction melting furnace using pure elements of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (purity >99.9%). The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm).
The CoCuFeMnNi alloy was obtained by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) of pure raw materials under low-pressure pure Ar atmosphere (450 mbar). The obtained buttons were remelted 6 times inside water-cooled copper crucible to ensure compositional homogeneity. Thereafter, the alloy was cold pressed to improve its workability and finally cold rolled into 1 mm thick laminas (90% cold work). The obtained samples were solution treated under Ar atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h and quenched in water. Such temperature was selected to obtain a single phase FCC microstructure: in fact, available CALPHAD simulations indicate that at 1000 °C the alloy falls well within a single FCC phase field. [, ]

The engineering stress versus strain curves of the FG and CG samples before and after HPT processing at different turns (1/4, 1, and 5 turns) are shown in Figure . The tensile curves indicate that samples in annealed condition exhibit low yield strength (YS) and high elongation to failure, whereas the HPT processing led to an enhancement in YS accompanied by a reduction in the elongation to failure. The strength-ductility trade-off is in agreement with the classic mechanical response of ultra-fine grained (UFG) metallic materials processed by SPD techniques. Table summarizes the relative data for the engineering YS, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and total elongation to failure (δ) for both the FG and CG samples. The CG sample in annealed condition shows a YS of ≈230 MPa, and the FG sample shows a relatively higher YS of ≈430 MPa. The higher YS observed in the FG sample can be attributed to the Hall-Petch strengthening effect. The UTSs of the FG and CG samples are 751 and 532 MPa, respectively, and the CG sample presents slightly higher total elongation to failure in comparison with the FG sample (CG ≈58% and FG ≈48%).

Figure shows the XRD patterns of fine-grained (FG) and coarse-grained (CG) samples before HPT processing (N = 0) and after five turns of HPT processing (N = 5). The XRD patterns of the annealed sample show a single FCC phase with no secondary phases, which confirms the thermodynamic calculations reported earlier for this HEA. The XRD patterns of HPT-processed samples also show a single FCC phase, indicating no evidence of phase transformation after HPT. Also, HPT processing leads to a significant peak broadening of XRD patterns, indicating grain refinement and lattice strain.
Figure presents the EBSD maps of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 HEA after annealing at 900 °C for 10 min (Figure a,b) and 1100 °C for 60 min (Figure c,d). Figure a,c shows inverse pole figure maps, and Figure b,d shows grain boundary maps. The Σ3 twin boundaries (TBs) and high-angle boundaries in grain boundary maps are shown by red and black colors, respectively. Both the annealed samples show completely recrystallized microstructure with abundant Σ3 boundaries. The samples annealed at 900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min resulted in microstructure with fine grains ( ≈ 3 μm) and coarse grains ( ≈ 60 μm), respectively. The average grain size is estimated using the EBSD analysis, without considering TBs.

The miniature-tensile specimens (a gauge length of 1.5 mm, a gauge width of 1 mm, and a thickness of 0.7 mm) were cut from the HPT disc using electro-discharge machining. The tensile specimens were cut from the disk, such that a gauge length of 1.5 mm is located 2.5 mm away from the HPT disc center. Room temperature tensile tests were carried out at a quasi-static strain rate of 1 × 10-3 s-1 using a universal testing machine (Instron 1361, Instron Crop.. USA). The tensile samples were sprayed with black and white speckles on the specimen surface before tensile testing, and a digital image correlation method with an optical 3D deformation analysis (DIC; ARAMIS v6.1, GOM Optical Tech.) was used to measure the tensile strain. Vickers microhardness tests on the HPT samples were performed across the radial direction by applying a load of 500 g and a holding time of 10 s.

The ingots of TiZrHfNbx HEAs were produced by vacuum arc melting (Edmund Buhler AM/0.2) mixtures of high purity raw elements (purity >99.95 % wt) in Ti-gettered argon atmosphere. The ingots were turned and remelted at least six times to achieve chemical homogeneity. The as-cast ingots were polished in parallel to 10 mm and cold rolled to 2 mm with thickness reduction about 80 %. The rolled plates were cut into small pieces and encapsulated into vacuum quartz tubes, followed by thermal annealing at 850 °C for 30 mins with water quenching.
The crystal structures of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE Da Vinci, Bruker) using Cu-Kα radiation with wavelength of 1.5418 Å The microstructure characterization the samples were carried out in a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LYRA3 GMU, TESCAN) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, X-MaxN, Oxford Instruments) for chemical analysis and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD, Nordlys Max3, Oxford Instruments) detector for crystallographic analysis. A customized grafting sample stage was integrated into this SEM device to enable the in-situ tensile test. The stage is pre-tilted at 70° to allow the top surface of the dog-bone sample to meet the acquisition requirements of the EBSD detector. For SEM analysis, the samples were first grinded using SiC sandpapers and then polished step by step using diamond and alumina oxidation suspension. The dislocation structure characterizations were conducted on a transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipment (FEI Talos F200X G2, Thermofisher). Whereas the atomic scale EDS mappings and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) contrast images were taken from the spherical aberration corrected TEM (FEI Spectra 300, Thermofisher) for the high-resolution images. The geometric phase analysis (GPA) analyses were carried out using an open-source program Strain ++ [46] in which different strain components of the atomic strain field can be obtained based on the high-resolution TEM images. The von Mises strain can be calculated through the relation: ε v o n m i s e s = ε x y 2 + 1 3 ( ε x x 2 + ε y y 2 + ε x x ε y y ) [47]. The TEM sheet samples were firstly mechanically grinded to a thickness about 40 μm, then punched into discs with diameter of 3mm. The sheet discs samples were further thinned using ion-beam milling to a thickness of electron transparency in a Precision Ion-beam Polish System (PIPS, PIPS II 695, Gatan). High-resolution X-ray diffraction was implemented in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Beamline-14B1) with beam energy of ~18.01 keV and the actual wavelength of 0 .06887nm.
The dog-bone shaped tensile samples with gauge length of 4 mm and cross-section area of 1 × 2 mm2 were cut from the recrystallized HEA plates by wire cutting machine. All the specimens were ground using SiC sandpapers with grind size from 180 to at least 1200 grit in order to remove potential oxidations and sampling defects. The tensile tests were performed along the rolling direction (RD), using a universal test machine (MTEST 5000 W Tensile Stage, GATAN) under quasistatic strain rate from 1 × 10-3s-1. A set of Digital image correlated (DIC) system was built along with it for the in-situ strain field analysis (Vic-2D, Correlated Solution). High temperature compression tests were conduction in the equipment (DIL 805A/D compression module, TA Instruments) under vacuum of at least 1 × 10-4 Pa with strain rate of 1 × 10-3s-1. The tensile test at different strain rates and strain rate jump tests were implemented on a LE5105 Universal test machine (Lishi Instrument).

Fig 2(a) shows the engineering stress-strain curves of recrystallized TiZrHfNbx HEA system. The TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy exhibit the highest yield strength about 726 MPa; however, its fracture strain is much limited ( ~ 8.76 %). In sharp contrast with TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy, the fracture strain of TiZrHfNb dramatically increased to about 33.21 % while maintaining a yield strength about 677MPa. The work hardening rate curves were also calculated and displayed in Fig. 2(b). Obviously, the work hardening ability dramatically increased with the increasing of Nb content. The work hardening rate of TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy drastically drops with almost no work hardening ability. In TiZrHfNb0.6 alloy, the work hardening rate first drops steeply at early stage and then slight increase with the enhancement of true stress by ~40 MPa over a ~10 % strain range. Similar trends were also observed in TiZrHfNb0.8 and TiZrHfNb HEAs with higher Nb content. At the onset of plastic deformation, dislocations in the TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy were initiated along certain slip planes, and the nearly unobstructed planar slip dislocations cause them to rapidly run into necking and then failure after the yielding. In contrast, the work hardening abilities of TiZrHfNb alloy are much more pronounced than TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy which indicate that the dislocation interactions and dislocation storage abilities of TiZrHfNb are much more different from TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy. The details of dislocation motion at the microscopic level will be elaborated in discussion part.
The mechanical behaviors of the TiZrHfNb0.8 and TiZrHfNb samples are quite similar in terms of tensile properties, with both retaining about 15 % uniform elongation before necking and accompanied by progressively work hardening lead to an increase of the true stress for more than 130 MPa. Fig 2(c) shows the comparison of fracture strain and yield strength for TiZrHfNbx alloy system with upward modulation of the Nb content. It indicates that the increasing of Nb content leads to a very intuitive increase in the tensile fracture strain of the alloys, from 8.76 % to 33.21 %, with the sacrifice of a rather minimal yield strength (less than 50 MPa). Fig 2(d) compares the yield strength and fracture strain of the present TiZrHfNbx alloys and other existing RHEA alloy systems. It clearly shows that these existing alloy systems could rarely escape form the strength-ductility dilemma, i.e.. the increasing of tensile ductility always accompanied by a large sacrifice of strength, as shown in the yellow shaded part of Fig. 2(d). However, the alloy system studied here was able to multiply its tensile ductility by modulating the Nb content while essentially maintain the yield strength of the alloys. This trend was not evidentially proven in the previous studies, and is quite different from the behavior of strength-ductility change of other alloy systems in Fig. 2(d).
Fig 4 shows the fracture surface of TiZrHfNbx HEA system. The fracture surface shrinkage becomes more and more severe with the increase of Nb content. The deformation ability of metallic materials can be assessed by the reduction in area. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy exhibited the worst deformation ability with the surface shrinkage ratio of 12.2 %. With the increasing of Nb content, the surface shrinkage ratio dramatically increases as about 62.6 % in TiZrHfNb0.6, 72.2 % in TiZrHfNb0.8 and 86.2 % in TiZrHfNb (Fig. 4(b-d)). From the enlarged view in Fig. 4(a), the TiZrHfNb0.4 sample exhibited a mixture of multiple fracture morphologies, with about half of the icing-like disintegrated fracture and the other small tough nest fracture surfaces which are generally tiny and very shallow. In Fig. 4(b), the fracture surface of TiZrHfNb0.6 transformed into a fully ductile fracture profile in which the drag marks around the perimeter of dimples with varying depths. The same trend is also followed by TiZrHfNb0.8 sample (Fig. 4(c)). The fracture surface exhibited larger and deeper dimples with some small dimples uniformly distributed among them. The fracture surface of TiZrHfNb sample is also composed of several large dimples in the width direction. The drag marks spreading around dimples are more centrally clustered which suggested the sample underwent through severe deformation prior to fracture.

phase
To examine the effect of Nb content on the phase stability of TiZrHfNbx alloy system. We first characterized the crystalline structures of TiZrHfNbx with x range from 0 to 1. As shown in Fig. S1, the TiZrHf alloy exhibit single phase HCP structure. With the increasing of Nb content, BCC structure come to appear and the TiZrHfNbx (x = 0.1,0.2,0.3) exhibit dual HCP+BCC structures. Further increase Nb content to x = 0.4, the TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy display single phase BCC structure. Therefore, the content of Nb (x = 0.4) is the lowest Nb content that guarantees a single-phase BCC structure of the alloy system. The XRD patterns of TiZrHfNbx (x = 0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0) HEAs are presented in Fig. 1(a) -(d). The results demonstrate that all the HEA samples examined here exhibit single-phase BCC structure and the addition of Nb element has no additional effect on the phase structure of the system. To eliminate the possibility of presence minor nanoprecipitation, the high-energy XRD experiments were implemented and the results are shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the alloys of TiZrHfNb0.4 and TiZrHfNb are all indeed exhibited single-phase BCC structures. The lattice constants of the BCC structure for TiZrHfNbx system vary within a reasonable range with the change of the Nb element content by a relatively small margin about 0.3453 nm to 0.3437 nm. The microstructures were also examined using EBSD and the inverse pole figure (IPF) images are shown in Fig.
1(e)-(h). All these samples exhibit equiaxed grain structures without obvious textures. The grain size for TiZrHfNb0.4, TiZrHfNb0.6, TiZrHfNb0.8 and TiZrHfNb are 56.01 μm, 37.04 μm, 26.01 μm and 24.52 μm respectively which gradually decreases with the increasing Nb content under the same heat treatment condition. The addition of refractory element Nb would lead to a rising of the melting point for the alloy matrix which would increase the activation energy of recrystallization [48]. Therefore, a slower recrystallization process was expected for these alloys with higher Nb content under the same heat treatment condition, in other words, finer grains were obtained. Additionally, we also performed the Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) analysis on the heat-treated specimens to ensure that the actual chemical compositions were consistent with the nominal values, as shown in Table 1 .
During plastic deformation, the plastic instabilities are strongly affected by the local strain fields. Before ultimate failure, the strain localization usually occurs firstly due to stress concentration which is associated with different deformation [54]. To study different deformation behaviors of TiZrHfNbx alloys, we adopted the in-situ DIC analysis to reveal the strain distribution evaluation at different deformation stages. As shown in Fig.3 (a), the TiZrHfNb0.4 sample exhibits a banded strain distribution around 45° at a relatively small total strain about 0.5 % right after yielding. The strain concentration band is more pronounced when the applied strain reaches 2 %. When the applied strain increased to 4 %, the strain concentration band extends to both sides of the sample at about 45° along the tensile direction which correspond to the rapid failure as indicated in stress strain curve (Fig. 2(a)). The same strain concentration phenomenon maintained until ultimate fracture. The linear distributions of local strain in TiZrHfNb0.4 sample are shown in Fig. 3(b). It illustrates that the sample has a slightly prominent localized strain in the middle region after yielding to 2 % strain. When the amount of deformation gradually increases, a more pronounced strain concentration can be observed, and the deformation is extremely inhomogeneous. On contrary, the TiZrHfNb sample maintains a uniform deformation in the gauge segment almost throughout the whole deformation stage as shown in Fig. 3(c). When the applied strain reaches to 25 %, a large necking occurs in the intermediate region of the sample, however, the strain field is still relatively homogeneous with no banded structures observed. The same conclusion can be confirmed from the linear distributions of local strain in Fig. 3(d) in which the TiZrHfNb sample shows a relatively smooth and uniform strain distribution throughout the gauge section before applied strain reaches to 25 %. With further increase of the applied strain, necking induced strain softening occurs and the local strains are concentrated in the middle section with symmetric distribution (Fig. 3(d)) which is sharp different with the deformation behavior of TiZrHfNb0.4 sample.

The dog-bone shaped tensile samples with gauge length of 4 mm and cross-section area of 1 × 2 mm2 were cut from the recrystallized HEA plates by wire cutting machine. All the specimens were ground using SiC sandpapers with grind size from 180 to at least 1200 grit in order to remove potential oxidations and sampling defects. The tensile tests were performed along the rolling direction (RD), using a universal test machine (MTEST 5000 W Tensile Stage, GATAN) under quasistatic strain rate from 1 × 10-3s-1. A set of Digital image correlated (DIC) system was built along with it for the in-situ strain field analysis (Vic-2D, Correlated Solution). High temperature compression tests were conduction in the equipment (DIL 805A/D compression module, TA Instruments) under vacuum of at least 1 × 10-4 Pa with strain rate of 1 × 10-3s-1. The tensile test at different strain rates and strain rate jump tests were implemented on a LE5105 Universal test machine (Lishi Instrument).
Here, we applied an edge dislocation strengthening theory proposed by Maresca and Curtin [62] to the examine the role of edge dislocation characteristic in the deformation process of highly concentrated TiZrHfNb alloy. In this theory, the edge dislocation was considered existing in a homogeneous "average" solid solution matrix. Each constituent atom was considered as a solute in the average alloy matrix with possess a misfit volume ∆Vi . Taking into the interactions among dislocation and solute atoms, the yield strength can be expressed as a function of temperature and strain rate, ε ˙ , with an ad-hoc adjustment [62]: (1) σ y ( T , ε ˙ ) = 3.067 τ y 0 exp [ - 1 0.55 ( k T Δ E b ln ε 0 ˙ ε ˙ ) 0.91 ] where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, ε 0 ˙ is the reference strain rate, 1.0 s - 1 [63].
The plastic deformation process is controlled by the interaction of dislocations with various atomic or nano scale barriers in the present HEAs. In general, the dislocation gliding is a stress assisted thermally activated process in which local barriers can be overcame by the thermal energies. Therefore, the plastic deformation rate can be affected by various factors such as temperature T, stress, microstructures etc. The strain rate ε ˙ can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation [69-71]: (6) ε ˙ = ε ˙ 0 exp ( - Δ G k B T ) = ε ˙ 0 exp ( - Δ F k B T + σ Δ V * 3 k B T ) where ε ˙ 0 is a pre-exponential constant on a characteristic strain rate at a given grain size, Δ G is the Gibbs free energy required for a gliding dislocation to overcome obstacles, k B is the Boltzmann constant, Δ F is the Helmholtz free energy that overcoming the obstacles to dislocation motions, or so-called activation enthalpy, σ is the flow stress, Δ V * is the effective activation volume. Therefore, the activation volume can be obtained using the following equation: (7) Δ V * = k B T 3 ln ( ε ˙ 2 / ε ˙ 1 ) Δ σ
The strain rate sensitive exponent is defined as m = ∂ l n σ / ∂ l n ε ˙ [69]. Therefore, the activation volume Δ V * can be related with m as: (8) Δ V * = 3 k B T m σ From the above Eq. (7), the strain rate jump test can be used to determine the volume [71]. The stress-strain curve from the strain rate jump test of TiZrHfNb alloy is shown in Fig. 13(a) . As for TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy, the uniaxial tensile tests at different strain rates were carried out instead of strain rate jump test due to the limited plastic strain. The stress-strain curves at different strain rate were shown in Fig. 13(b). According to the work of Peter Liaw et al. [71], either uniaxial testing at different strain rates or the strain rate jump test could calculate the strain rate sensitivity exponent and activation volume. The strength versus strain rate of TiZrHfNb and TiZrHfNb0.4 alloys were plotted in Fig. 13(c). The strain rate sensitive m can be obtained through the linear fitting of σ and l n ε ˙ . Meanwhile, the activation volume Δ V * can also be obtained through Eq. (8) .
The strain rate sensitive m and activation volume Δ V * are summarized in Table 3 in which the activation volume can be normalized by b3 where b is the magnitude of Burger vector. The magnitude of activation volume can be used to differentiate different deformation mechanism. As for the TiZrHfNb0.4 alloy, the magnitude of activation volume is about 6.09 b 3 , which is in line with kink-pair nucleation on a gliding screw dislocation mechanism [69]. However, the activation volume of TiZrHfNb alloy is much higher than that in TiZrHfNb0.4 sample, which may due to the dislocation interaction effect [72]. For the concentrated solid solution alloys, the solute atoms forest may act as local stress center to distort the straight dislocation line resulting a waved dislocation configuration as in TiZrHfNb alloys. The forest solute atoms in multicomponent alloy would also introduce to local short range stress fields which can effectively promote the planar slip and localized the dislocations into narrow band as in the case of TiZrHfNb0.4 and TiZrHfNb alloys [69].

Ingots of Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were fabricated by vacuum arc-melting of pure metals (purity > 99.9 wt.%) under an inert gas (high-purity argon) atmosphere. After melting, they were cooled in a water-cooled copper mold and flipped and re-melted five times to improve compositional homogeneity. Subsequently, the ingots were cold-rolled to a 30% reduction in thickness and homogenized at 1100 °C for 24 h. Then, the homogenized plate of the Co60Ni40 alloy and the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were further cold-rolled to a 92% reduction in thickness and annealed at 750 °C for 120 s and 850 °C for 3.6 ks, respectively. These processes yielded fully-recrystallized microstructures of FCC single phase having similar mean grain sizes of about 3 μm (including annealing twins) in the two alloys.
Deformation microstructure observations were conducted by using TEM (JEM-2100/2100F, JEOL Ltd.) equipped with a bright field (BF) detector and an annular dark field (ADF) detector for scanning TEM (STEM), operated at 200 kV. The TEM observation plane was parallel to the sheet surface plane of the tensile specimens. Foil specimens for TEM observations were mechanically polished until the thickness reached 50 μm by using SiC sandpapers with #1000 - #4000 grit sizes. Subsequently, they were electrically polished in a solution of 10 vol.% HClO4, 20 vol.% glycerin, and 70 vol.% CH3OH at 15 V and 243 K by using a twin-jet electropolishing machine (Tenupol-5, Struers Ltd.). Diffraction contrast of lattice defects was observed under the two-beam conditions in both TEM and STEM [58-60]. The camera length of STEM detectors and spot size of the electron beam were set to 40 cm and 1 nm, respectively, which were the optimal conditions for the deformation microstructure observations of the materials in the microscopes. Crystallographic orientation of each observed grain was determined based on the Kikuchi patterns formed by convergent electron beam diffraction and analyzed by a semi-automatic procedure [61,62]. For each deformation condition, about 20-30 grains from the two foil specimens were examined to obtain statistically reliable results.
Tensile tests were conducted at room temperature to evaluate the mechanical properties. Small-scaled dog-bone specimens with a gauge length of 2 mm and a gauge cross-section of 1 mm × 0.5 mm were cut from the recrystallized materials. Tensile deformation was applied with an initial strain rate of 8.3 × 10-4 s-1 until fracture. In-situ strain measurements during tensile deformation were performed by using the digital image correlation (DIC) method [57]. It has already been verified in our previous studies [40,41] that tensile tests with such small-scaled specimens and DIC methods yield highly reliable stress-strain curves, comparable to those measured using standard-size specimens with an extensometer. To investigate the deformation microstructure evolution, tensile deformation was interrupted at engineering strains of 2, 10, 30, and 50%.

Fig. 2 (a) plots the engineering stress - engineering strain curves of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA. The yield strength (0.2% proof stress) of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were 140 MPa and 375 MPa, respectively. The contribution of grain size to the yield strength (the Hall-Petch effect), kd -1/2, can be calculated as 103 MPa and 101 MPa for the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA, respectively, based on their nearly identical Hall-Petch slopes, as shown in Table 1. Therefore, the difference in the yield strength (235 MPa) corresponds well with the difference in the friction stress (= 228 MPa) in the materials. The ultimate tensile strengths of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were 419 MPa and 685 MPa, respectively. Generally, there is a trade-off relationship between strength and ductility of materials. Thus, materials having higher strength tend to exhibit lower ductility. However, despite the difference in the flow stress, interestingly, the two alloys showed almost the same ductility (fractured at e ~ 0.72). Fig. 2(b) shows work-hardening rate - true strain curves of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA plotted together with the true stress - true strain curves. It was found that the work-hardening rate of the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA was higher than that of the Co60Ni40 alloy. The crossing points between the work-hardening rate curves and the true stress - true strain curves are where necking occurs, satisfying the plastic instability condition [49], expressed as (1) d σ d ε ≤ σ , where σ and ε are true stress and true strain, respectively. Eq. (1) suggests that necking was retarded in the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA owing to the higher work-hardening ability, resulting in a similar uniform and fracture elongations as in the Co60Ni40 alloy.
It should be noted that the E h k l can be determined by assuming that σ h k l = σ (applied stress) during elastic deformation [84]. We estimated the E h k l of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA as presented in Table 2 . As the E h k l values of these alloys are comparable, their elastic constants and anisotropies are expected to be also similar [85]. These E h k l values are also close to those of other FCC high-alloy systems with low SFE reported previously (e.g.. HEAs/MEAs and austenitic steels [84-87]). In Fig. 7 (a), we show the internal stress in grains of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA oriented to TA ~//〈1 1 1〉, 〈2 0 0〉, and 〈3 1 1〉 as a function of applied true strain, calculated based on stroke of the tensile test machine. It was found that the internal stress development in the Co60Ni40 alloy was almost independent of 〈h k l〉, while, in the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA, the internal stress varied depending on the orientation. This suggests that the deformation microstructures evolution in the Co60Ni40 alloy is relatively homogeneous, while those in the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA is heterogeneous (i.e.. orientation-dependent). This was well consistent with the results of the deformation microstructure observations (Section 3.3). Fig. 7(b) shows a ratio of integral intensity of {1 1 1} and {2 0 0} peaks (I 111/I 200) of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA as a function of applied ture strain.
The material properties of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA are listed in Table 1 . The lattice constants of FCC structure were determined to be 0.3535 nm and 0.3559 nm for the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA, respectively, based on the synchrotron XRD measurements before deformation. The friction stresses of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were determined to be 52 MPa and 280 MPa, respectively, at room temperature based on our previous studies [40,41,55]. Figs. 1 (a) and (b) show SEM-BSE micrographs of initial microstructures of the Co60Ni40 and Co20Cr40Ni40, respectively. Equiaxed grains with profuse annealing twin boundaries were seen in both alloys. Textures of these materials were close to random, given the characteristics of recrystallization texture in FCC metals [70]. Mean grain sizes of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were found to be 3.10 μm and 2.79 μm by the intercept method. Other material properties (SFE, homologous temperature at room temperature, shear modulus, and the Hall-Petch slope) were extracted from the literature [41,42,51,71]. It should be noted that the accuracy of the SFE values reported in the literature [53,54] was verified again based on separation distance of dissociated dislocations measured by our own WBDF-TEM observations [72], and possible artifacts due to the high friction stress of the MEA, pointed out by some recent studies [73-75], were technically avoided by observing multiple grains with different orientations (see supplementary materials for the details). It is also noteworthy that the elastic anisotropies of the two alloys, which are related to atomic bonding state in crystals, were experimentally estimated to be comparable, as described later in Section 3.5. Therefore, average energy landscape of generalized SFE and resultant twinability [76] of the materials are expected to be comparable, according to the literature [77-80]. The data above clearly indicate that the material properties of the Co60Ni40 alloy and Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA were very close, except for the friction stresses.

Fig. 4 presents the deformation microstructure evolution in the tensile-deformed Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA with different strains. It was found that the microstructure could be classified into three types depending on the grain orientation, as shown in Fig. 5(b): (Type A) Randomly-tangled dislocations were seen at the early stage of deformation, and DCs with a size of several tens of nanometers developed with increasing strain in TA ~//〈1 0 0〉 oriented grains; (Type B) Planar slip of dislocations was seen at the early stage, and PDS subsequently formed along one of {1 1 1} planes in most grains except for those oriented such that TA ~// < 1 0 0 > ; (Type B-T) PDS developed in more than two {1 1 1} planes, and DTs with a thickness of several nanometers started nucleating after an applied strain of e ~ 10% in TA ~//〈1 1 1〉 oriented grains. It seemed that the number fraction of DTs increased with increasing applied strain, while the thickness did not change significantly. It should be noted that the PDS and DTs observed in Type B and B-T grains were mainly lying on a {1 1 1} plane belonging to the 〈1 1 0〉 {1 1 1} slip system having the highest Schmid factor (the primary slip system). The deformation microstructures and their orientation dependence in this alloy closely resembled those reported in both single-crystals and poly-crystals of other FCC high-alloy systems, as described in Section 1. Additionally, we note that, in our preliminary work on the same MEA tensile-deformed at room temperature [56], we observed a very small fraction of deformation-induced martensite with a hexagonal close-packed structure after necking. However, since the phase fraction is very small (~ 0.4% volume fraction after fracture), the martensitic transformation can have negligible impacts on the evolution of deformation microstructures and the macroscopic mechanical properties of the alloy, and the effect is therefore omitted in this study.
Since the structural information obtained by TEM was very local and qualitative, we investigated the deformation behavior through in-situ high-energy XRD measurements during tensile deformation. With increasing applied strain, all peaks shifted and broadened. In addition, intensity of each peak changed (see supplementary information). Based on shift in each peak, elastic deformation in grains having similar orientations can be determined [83]. Elastic strain (εhkl ) in grains oriented to TA ~//〈h k l〉 is calculated as (2) ε h k l = d h k l - d h k l 0 d h k l 0 , where d h k l and d h k l 0 are lattice spacing of {h k l} planes during deformation and before deformation, respectively. By multiplying a diffraction elastic modulus ( E h k l ), internal stress ( σ h k l ) in grains oriented to TA ~//〈h k l〉 is calculated by (3) σ h k l = E h k l ε h k l .
Three-dimensional structure of the PDS in Type B grains of the Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA was revealed by ET. Reconstructed dislocation structure of a Type B grain in the 5% deformed Co20Cr40Ni40 MEA can be seen in supplementary videos 1 (aligned image series) and 2 (reconstructed structure by the weighted back-projection algorithm). Figs. 6 (a-i) show WBDF-TEM images of the dislocation structure taken at different tilt-angles. Based on the images taken with different g-vectors, we determined the Burgers vectors of the dislocations according to the g b criteria [81]. It should be noted that dislocations in the material dissociated into two Shockley partials and an intrinsic stacking fault (ISF), owing to its low SFE. For example, in Fig. 6(a), the slip systems of some of the dislocations were identified to be the following: Slip system 1 ( red ) : a 2 [ 1 0 1 ‾ ] ( 1 1 1 ) → a 6 [ 2 1 ‾ 1 ‾ ] ( 1 1 1 ) + ISF + a 6 [ 1 1 2 ‾ ] ( 1 1 1 ) Slip system 2 ( blue ) : a 2 [ 1 ‾ 1 0 ] ( 1 1 1 ‾ ) → a 6 [ 1 ‾ 2 1 ] ( 1 1 1 ‾ ) + ISF + a 6 [ 2 ‾ 1 1 ‾ ] ( 1 1 1 ‾ ) These dislocations are colored red and blue in Fig. 6(a'), while the rest undetermined dislocations are colored white.

Tensile tests were conducted at room temperature to evaluate the mechanical properties. Small-scaled dog-bone specimens with a gauge length of 2 mm and a gauge cross-section of 1 mm × 0.5 mm were cut from the recrystallized materials. Tensile deformation was applied with an initial strain rate of 8.3 × 10-4 s-1 until fracture. In-situ strain measurements during tensile deformation were performed by using the digital image correlation (DIC) method [57]. It has already been verified in our previous studies [40,41] that tensile tests with such small-scaled specimens and DIC methods yield highly reliable stress-strain curves, comparable to those measured using standard-size specimens with an extensometer. To investigate the deformation microstructure evolution, tensile deformation was interrupted at engineering strains of 2, 10, 30, and 50%.
To quantify deformation behavior of the materials, we also conducted in-situ high-energy XRD measurements during tensile deformation at the beamline 46XU of a synchrotron radiation facility, Super Photon ring - 8 GeV (SPring-8) in Hyogo, Japan. Plate-type dog-bone specimens having a gauge length of 10 mm and a gauge cross-section of 3 mm × 0.5 mm were cut from the same recrystallized materials as described in Section 2.1. Tensile deformation was applied in a load frame attached to a goniometer at room temperature with an initial strain rate of 8.3 × 10-4 s-1 until fracture. Incident X-ray beam with an energy of 30 keV (wavelength of 0.0413 nm) and a spot size of 0.5 mm (length) × 0.5 mm (width) was irradiated on the center of the gauge part of the tensile specimens. Transmission-diffracted X-ray beams were detected by a one-dimensional semiconductor detector (MYTHEM, Dectris) covering a 2θ range of 5° - 35°. The exposure time (data acquisition time) for each profile was set to 1.0 s to achieve a better signal-noise ratio, and diffraction profiles were collected continuously during the tensile testing. The incident X-ray beam was precisely monochromated by a double mirror silicon monochromator. A camera length between the specimens and the detector was adjusted by a computer-controlled four-axis goniometer. Also, the direction of the incident beam was adjusted to be perpendicular to the tensile specimen surface. The system was calibrated by using a well-annealed standard CeO2 sample before the measurements.

All the Cantor alloy, Si10 HEA, and Si12 HEA were prepared via arc melting of high-purity elements (purity > 99.9%) under an argon gas atmosphere, and the melting was repeated more than five times to ensure chemical homogenization. The as-cast ingots were homogenized at 1423 K for 12 h under a high-purity argon gas atmosphere, followed by water quenching to ambient temperature. The ingots were then hot-compressed to 3 mm-thick plates (50% reduction in thickness) at 1373 K in air, followed by water quenching. The oxide layers were removed by grinding and then the plates were cold rolled to 1.8 mm (40% reduction in thickness) at room temperature. Finally, the samples were annealed at 1373 K for a short period (Cantor, 10 min; Si10 HEA and Si12 HEA, 2 min), followed by water quenching to ambient temperature, to obtain recrystallized microstructures with grain sizes of approximately 60 μm (similar for the three alloys, see Fig. 1 and Table 2). The grain sizes were determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7100F) equipped with an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector. The observations were made at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV, and the EBSD data were analyzed using OIM analysis software (version 7.0).
We designed Si-substituted HEAs based on the following considerations. We selected the well-known Co20Cr20Fe20Ni20Mn20 (at%) Cantor alloy as the base HEA. The Si was utilized as a representative metalloid, which is a substitutional element for Mn but differs in atomic size, crystal structure, electronic structure, and physical properties of all the constituent transition metals. We aimed to obtain single-phase solid solutions containing as much Si as possible, limited by the solubility of Si in the HEA. For instance, (Mn, Cr, Si)-rich precipitates were found when 10 at% Si was added into the Cantor alloy (forming Co18Cr18Fe18Ni18Mn18Si10 (at.%), Fig. S1). Because Mn has the largest atomic radius, decreasing the content of Mn could help to increase the solubility of Si, as suggested by the Hume-Rothery theory and its derivatives [25-27]. Therefore, we decreased the content of Mn to increase the solubility of Si and successfully prepared a single-phase Co20Cr20Fe20Ni20Mn10Si10 (at%) sample without precipitates, hereinafter denoted as Si10 HEA. In addition, we removed Mn altogether to further increase the solubility of Si and successfully prepared Co22Cr22Fe22Ni22Si12 (at%) HEA with a single-phase structure, hereinafter denoted as Si12 HEA.

mechanical
We first report their impressive behavior in standard tensile tests, to make the point that their simultaneous elevation of strength and ductility, with respect to the base Cantor alloy, is attractive and worthy of detailed investigation (to be pursued in the succeeding sub-sections). Fig. 2 a shows the tensile stress-strain curves of the HEAs at room temperature. Here, the alloys being compared have almost identical grain sizes (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The 0.2% offset yield strength increased from 201 MPa (Cantor alloy) to 306 MPa (Si10 HEA) and 332 MPa (Si12 HEA). The ultimate tensile strength has been raised from 543 MPa (Cantor alloy) to 792 MPa (Si10 HEA) and 843 MPa (Si12 HEA). Of special note is that the Si-substituted HEAs exhibit a very high strain-hardening rate, as shown in Fig. 2b, which only slowly decreases during tensile deformation. This delays the initiation of necking to 60% true strain when the strain hardening rate (the upper purple curve) intersects the true stress curve (the lower purple stress-strain curve), as known from the Considere criterion. The engineering uniform tensile strain is as high as ~85%, whereas the total tensile strain to failure reaches almost 100%, both exceeding the best of all known metals at room temperature. Compared with the Cantor alloy, this percent elongation is approximately 30% higher. Similarly, a Ge-containing HEA (Fig. S7) also exhibited such simultaneously enhanced strength and ductility. The mechanical properties for both the Si- and Ge- substituted HEAs could be improved even more via further optimization of composition and thermomechanical processing.
Previously, replacing Mn with Pd in the Cantor alloy enhanced the yield and ultimate tensile strengths but decreased the tensile elongation [6]. Overall, the combination of strength and tensile ductility of the Si-containing HEAs, as indicated in Fig. 2c, is unprecedented compared with other single- or multiple- phase HEAs and conventional alloys [52]. Fig. 2d compares the changes in strength and ductility of FCC HEAs tailored using metallic elements in the literature with the HEAs containing metalloids (Si and Ge) in the present study. The addition of metallic constituents, such as Al, Hf, Mo, Nb, and W, generally strengthens the HEA while compromising its ductility [9,10,53-56]. In contrast, the metalloidal Si and Ge are able to evade this trade-off, with a synergistic strength-ductility combination that distinguishes the tailored HEAs from other metallic materials. Obviously, the increase in strength and ductility must have its origin in the micro- and nano- scale structure in the alloy, which we analyze in detail in the following.
The in situ neutron diffraction measurements during tensile deformation indicates that the dislocation density in the two Si-containing HEAs increases with increasing tensile strain, to a level as high as 18.8 × 1015 m - 2 and 22.3 × 1015 m - 2 at a strain of 73.3% and 65.3% as indicated in Fig. 13b, respectively. In comparison, the dislocation density in the Cantor alloy increases much more slowly and reaches a maximum value of 7 × 1015 m - 2 at a strain of 53.8%. We also note that the dislocation density during tensile deformation of the CoCrFeNi (SFE: 27 ± 4 mJ/m2) and CoCrNi (SFE: 18 ± 4 mJ/m2) MEAs exhibits analogous behavior to the Cantor alloy [94]. The maximum dislocation densities in the two MEAs are 3.4 × 1015 m - 2 (CoCrFeNi) and 9.6 × 1015 m - 2 (CoCrNi) at a strain of 60% [94], which are much smaller than that of 14 × 1015 m - 2 (Si10) and 15.5 × 1015 m - 2 (Si12) at a similar level of strain. For the Cantor alloy, even at an ultra-low temperature of 15 K, the dislocation density saturated at a maximum value of 9.4 × 1015 m - 2 at a tensile strain of 45% [95]. All these indicate that a higher dislocation density is accumulated in the Si-containing HEAs than those in the two MEAs and Cantor HEA, explaining the elevated strain hardening rate and hence large uniform elongation seen in the stress-strain curve in Fig. 2. Aside from stored dislocations, the HCP phase is formed in the Si12 HEA (Figs. 12f and 13c), with its volume fraction increasing with the increase in strain, reaching 9.2% at a strain of 65.3%. In contrast, the HCP volume fraction formed in Si10 HEA during in-situ tension is insignificant.

On the sub-nanometer to the atomic scale, however, the Si-containing HEAs are inhomogeneous. This is revealed via STEM observation under optimum conditions. Fig. 3b shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image captured from the [110]FCC zone axis and the corresponding elemental distribution map acquired from the atomic-scale EDS mapping of the Si10 HEA. The six elements (Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mn, and Si) are represented by different colors, and the brightness reflects the concentration of the elements in each atomic column. The concentration of each element fluctuates notably, which is also confirmed from the EDS line profiles in Fig. 3c. Fig. 4b shows the atomic-resolution HAADF image and the corresponding elemental distribution map acquired from the EDS mapping for each individual element in the Si12 HEA (Fig. S2). Fig. 4c displays the intensity of each element along the atomic rows denoted in Fig. 4b. The elemental concentrations undulate on the sub-nanometer scale. Similar to Si10 HEA, the elements of Si12 HEA (Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Si) also show undulated distributions beyond statistical fluctuation. By contrast, in the Cantor alloy, less undulation of the constituent elements was reported previously [6]. Our preliminary results above suggest that Si substitutional solutes may have increased sub-nanoscale compositional inhomogeneity.
The in situ neutron diffraction measurements during tensile deformation indicates that the dislocation density in the two Si-containing HEAs increases with increasing tensile strain, to a level as high as 18.8 × 1015 m - 2 and 22.3 × 1015 m - 2 at a strain of 73.3% and 65.3% as indicated in Fig. 13b, respectively. In comparison, the dislocation density in the Cantor alloy increases much more slowly and reaches a maximum value of 7 × 1015 m - 2 at a strain of 53.8%. We also note that the dislocation density during tensile deformation of the CoCrFeNi (SFE: 27 ± 4 mJ/m2) and CoCrNi (SFE: 18 ± 4 mJ/m2) MEAs exhibits analogous behavior to the Cantor alloy [94]. The maximum dislocation densities in the two MEAs are 3.4 × 1015 m - 2 (CoCrFeNi) and 9.6 × 1015 m - 2 (CoCrNi) at a strain of 60% [94], which are much smaller than that of 14 × 1015 m - 2 (Si10) and 15.5 × 1015 m - 2 (Si12) at a similar level of strain. For the Cantor alloy, even at an ultra-low temperature of 15 K, the dislocation density saturated at a maximum value of 9.4 × 1015 m - 2 at a tensile strain of 45% [95]. All these indicate that a higher dislocation density is accumulated in the Si-containing HEAs than those in the two MEAs and Cantor HEA, explaining the elevated strain hardening rate and hence large uniform elongation seen in the stress-strain curve in Fig. 2. Aside from stored dislocations, the HCP phase is formed in the Si12 HEA (Figs. 12f and 13c), with its volume fraction increasing with the increase in strain, reaching 9.2% at a strain of 65.3%. In contrast, the HCP volume fraction formed in Si10 HEA during in-situ tension is insignificant.
The neutron diffraction profile (see Fig. 12) shows that both HEAs remain FCC single-phase alloys. The lattice parameters at ambient temperature are 3.571 Å (Si10 HEA) and 3.569 Å (Si12 HEA), which are smaller than that of the base Cantor alloy (3.597 Å) [58]. Because the atomic radius of metalloid Si (1.153 Å) is smaller than those of metallic Mn (1.350 Å), Co (1.251 Å), Cr (1.249 Å), Fe (1.241 Å), and Ni (1.246 Å), which are equal to half the shortest interatomic distance in condensed metals [59-61]. These Si-containing HEAs exhibit larger values of mean square atomic displacement (MSAD) than the Cantor alloy, (see Fig. 5 a) both for each element and for their average value; a larger MSAD value represents a more severe local lattice distortion (LLD). Therefore, the two Si-containing HEAs are FCC solid solutions without segregation or clustering, but the Si substitution clearly escalates LLD. This is expected to effectively increase the strength [62], from the solid solution strengthening theory, which purports that atomic size and modulus misfits would cause an increased frictional force against dislocation slip [63-65]. There is also a change in the shear modulus from 82 GPa (CoCrFeMnNi) and 85 GPa (CoCrFeNi) to 72.3 GPa (Si10 HEA) and 74.2 GPa (Si12 HEA) (Table 2 ).

Measurement of mechanical properties. Dog-bone-shaped tensile samples were sliced from the plates with a thickness of 1.8 mm, and then the surfaces were polished to about 1.5 mm using abrasive papers up to 2000#, with the purpose of removing the surface oxide layers. The tensile samples have a gage dimension of 2.5 mm x 6.4 mm x 1.5 mm, in width, gage length, and thickness, respectively. The ambient-temperature uniaxial tensile tests were conducted using an Instron Model 5582 test frame. A 100 kN load cell operating at a strain rate of 1.0 × 10-3 s- 1 was utilized. The tensile strain was measured using digital image correlation (DIC, ARAMIS 5 M, GOM). Three independent samples were tested for each alloy to confirm reproducibility. Strain rate jump tests were conducted at room temperature, during which the strain rate jumps back and forth between 10-4 and 10-3 s- 1. The shear modulus and Poisson's ratio of the bulk samples were measured using a sing-around measurement technique (Ultrasonic Engineering UVM-2).
The various types of debris discussed above introduce obstacles to dislocation motion. One way to gage their effects is to measure the thermal activation parameters, i.e.. the apparent activation volume (Vapp.) of dislocations and the strain rate sensitivity (m) of flow stress, using strain-rate jump tests (Fig. 11 a). The Si10- and Si12- HEAs exhibited a higher m than the Cantor alloy at all strains (Fig. 11b). This indicates that the Si-containing HEAs will exhibit more strain-rate hardening after the initiation of necking, which prolongs post-necking elongation and contributes to the increased tensile ductility [79]. The value of Vapp. for the Si-containing HEAs is much smaller, by a factor of 2 to 3, than that of the Cantor alloy during the entire deformation process, indicating that the dislocation motion in the HEAs encounters a much larger number of local obstacles than that in the Cantor alloy (Fig. 11c) [75]. This is also reflected by the Haasen plot [93] (Fig. 11d). Compared with the Cantor alloy, the Si10- and Si12- HEAs possess notably more strengthening obstacles (defects left by partial dislocations, in the presence of structural and chemical inhomogeneities) that require thermal activation to overcome. There are multiple strengthening obstacles at work, thus it is difficult to directly associate the measured activation parameters with a particular activated process (interaction of moving dislocation with a specific type of obstacle). However, our point is that the activation volume of the Si-containing HEA is obviously smaller than that in the base Cantor alloy, indicating that the substitution of Si has indeed changed the activated process. Specifically, the process now involves the activation of a smaller dislocation segment (smaller Vapp.) at the critical saddle point, giving rise to higher m. These changes in activation parameters are indicative of the mechanism changes one would expect from the presence of extra inhomogeneities, lending further support to the notion that dislocations behave differently in the Si-HEAs relative to the reference (Cantor alloy).
Consequently, dislocation cell structures were not observed in the Si-containing HEAs. Furthermore, the high density of SFs, ultra-fine twin, and/or HCP phase formed during straining notably decreases the value of Λ , thus enhancing the dislocation storage capacity (strain hardening ability) and improving the flow stress (strength) [100-102]. The SFs on two variant slip planes in fact form Lomer-Cottrell sessile dislocations; these locks act as barriers to the glide of other dislocations on the two planes, which further reduces the mean free path of dislocations ( Λ ) [103,104]. All these contribute to dislocation reaction/interactions that multiply and store dislocations to sustain a large strain hardening ability to very high strains and flow stresses. The large strain hardening ability delays the initiation of necking, thus enlarging the uniform elongation, see Fig. 2. What is more, the increased strain rate sensitivity of the Si10 and Si12 HEAs contributes to a larger post-necking elongation. As a result, both the strength and ductility of the Si-tailored HEAs are superior to those of the Cantor alloy. Sorting out quantitatively each of the terms in Eq. (5) would certainly be of interest, but is a tall order for a complex concentrated alloy. In any case, the beauty of introducing Si metalloid solutes into the base solution is that it brings forth several beneficial effects [15,78] all at once: increased LLD and chemical inhomogeneities to boost strength, but more importantly, lowered SFE and more partial dislocation activities to effectively store dislocations. The outcome of such concurrently incorporated strengthening and strain hardening is the simultaneously elevated strength and tensile elongation [15].
