   Abstract
  </h2>
  <p>
   Two new non-centrosymmetric ternary compounds, MgSiAs2 and Mg3Si6As8, are discovered via metal flux and solid-state synthetic methods. MgSiAs2 belongs to the well-known II-IV-V2 family, which is extensively studied experimentally and computationally for their optical properties. MgSiAs2 is computationally predicted but not experimentally known prior to this work. Mg3Si6As8 crystallizes in a new non-centrosymmetric cubic chiral structure type with the Pearson symbol cP68. The syntheses, crystal structure, thermal and chemical stabilities, electronic structures, and optical properties of these two new compounds are investigated in this work. Optical absorption measurements and electronic structure calculations reveal the two compounds to be direct or pseudo-direct bandgap semiconductors (1.8-2 eV). The crystal structures of both compounds are non-centrosymmetric, though Mg3Si6As8 belongs to the 432 chiral crystal class, which is optically active but does not exhibit second harmonic generation (SHG) behavior. The SHG response of MgSiAs2 is 60% of that for AgGaS2, but MgSiAs2 exhibits a higher laser damage threshold than AgGaS2 at 33.2 MW cm-2.

   1 Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials play a key role in laser science and technology due to their ability to upconvert frequencies of incoming light. This technology is widely used in solid-state lasers. Only crystallographically non-centrosymmetric (NCS) compounds can have NLO performance according to the Neumann principle. Based on their transmission and applied spectrum scope, NLO materials can be classified as UV-NLO materials, visible-NLO materials, or infrared-NLO (IR-NLO) materials. IR-NLO materials are technologically relevant due to their use in optoelectronic devices, resource exploration, and long-distance laser communications applied in the infrared region (2-20 µm). Certain commercial IR-NLO materials, such as AgGaX2 (X = S, Se) and ZnGeP2, have high second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients. The widespread application of current IR commercial materials is hindered by many intrinsic drawbacks, such as low laser damage thresholds (LDT) or two-photon absorption. Therefore, searching for new IR-NLO materials with higher LDT is an important challenge for materials chemistry in the IR-NLO field.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many members of the ABC2 family are IR-NLO materials. This NLO family covers a broad scope of chemical compositions where either AII = Mg, Zn, Cd; BIV = Si, Ge, Sn; and CV = P, As, Sb; or AI = Ag, Au; BIII = Ga, In; and CVI = S, Se, Te. ABC2 compounds crystallize within the chalcopyrite structure type in the space group I-42d (No. 122). The commercial IR-NLO materials AgGaX2 (X = S, Se)[] and ZnGeP2[] belong to this family. Other ABC2 compounds, such as ZnSiP2 and CdSiP2, have recently garnered significant interest due to their potential as IR-NLO materials or for luminescence applications. In addition to excellent performance as IR-NLO materials, the ABC2 family compounds have also been widely explored for photovoltaic and optical applications. Despite its mature investigational history, the ABC2 family is far from being fully explored. Many compounds are only predicted by theory, and their experimental properties are rarely reported. [, ] MgSiAs2 is one of these cases. To the best of our knowledge, MgSiAs2 has only been reported by theorists via simulations of its crystal structure combined with calculations of physical properties. As the first ternary compound in the Mg-Si-As system, MgSiAs2 crystallizes as a crystallographically NCS structure with good SHG performance. Another NCS compound, Mg3Si6As8, was also discovered during the exploration of the Mg-Si-As system. Herein, we present the first experimental syntheses of these compounds, crystal structure determinations by single crystal diffraction, thermal and chemical stabilities, optical bandgaps, and SHG and LDT properties.

  <h2>
   2 Experimental Section
  </h2>
  <p>
   All preparation and handling of samples were performed in an argon-filled glove box with the O2 level below 1 ppm. Magnesium turnings (Alfa Aesar, 99.98%), crystalline silicon powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), polycrystalline arsenic lump (Alfa Aesar, 99.99999+%), and polycrystalline bismuth lump (Alfa Aesar, 99.998%) were all used as received.
  </p>
  <p>
   MgSiAs2 Crystal: A single crystal of MgSiAs2 was originally found in reaction products of a sample containing Mg, Ge, As, and CsCl. The reaction mixture was placed in an evacuated and flame-sealed silica tube, which was annealed at 1123 K. After cooling, a red transparent crystal was found as a side phase. The source of Si was from the reduction of the silica ampoule with either Mg or Ge.
  </p>
  <p>
   MgSiAs2 Powder: Single-phase polycrystalline samples of MgSiAs2 were synthesized by loading Mg:Si:As = 1.2:1:2 into carbonized silica ampoules under ambient conditions. The ampoules were sealed under vacuum ( ≈ 10-2 mbar) and then heated up to 1123 K over 17 h and annealed at that temperature for 144 h. After cooling to room temperature, the ampoules were opened in the glove box, the samples were ground with an agate mortar and pestle, and then reannealed with the same heating profile as previously reported. The annealing and grinding cycle was completed a total of three times. Single-phase MgSiAs2 was finally collected after acid treatment (HCl:H2O = 1:1) of the annealed powder (Figure ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Mg3Si6As8 Crystal: Single crystals of Mg3Si6As8, measuring up to 3 × 1.5 × 1 mm3, were grown using stoichiometric ratios of Mg, Si, and As and a 50 molar excess of Bi flux. The mixture was loaded into evacuated and flame-sealed carbonized silica ampoules with silica wool placed at the top end of the ampoule to be used as a filter during centrifugation. The sample was heated to 1123 K in 17 h and annealed for 140 h. Bi flux was subsequently removed by high-temperature centrifugation. Any remaining Bi was dissolved in a wash of one part glacial acetic acid (Alfa Aesar, 99+%) and three parts water with 2% volume of hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Chemical, 30%). A few milliliters of concentrated HCl (Fisher Chemical, 37% w/w) was used to remove any Bi2O3 that remained in the wash after the initial filtering. The products were filtered and rinsed with water, and then air dried. Red single crystals were manually picked out for further analysis and stored in an argon filled glove box.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mg3Si6As8 Powder: Almost phase-pure polycrystalline samples of Mg3Si6As8 were synthesized by first loading carbonized silica ampoules with stoichiometric ratios of Mg, Si, and As under ambient conditions with a total weight of 0.5 g. All attempts to scale the synthesis to higher quantities resulted in incomplete reactions. The same heating profile for MgSiAs2 powders was used. After the first annealing, the products were ground in an agate mortar and pestle in the glove box, and additional Mg (about 1 molar ratio for Mg3Si6As8) was added. Three sets of grinding and annealing were sufficient to acquire an almost pure target phase. The resulting sample still contained small admixtures of Si and SiAs even after washing with HCl:H2O (Figure 1). The produced red powder was stored in an argon filled glove box.
  </p>

   Further details of the crystal structure investigations may be obtained from the Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen (Germany), on quoting the depository numbers CSD-434187 and CSD-434188. In addition, the data were deposited to The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC Nos. 1824592 and 1824593.

  <h2>
   3 Methods
  </h2>
  <h3>
   3.1 Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
  </h3>
  <p>
   Powder XRD patterns were acquired using a Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer and Cu-Kα radiation with a Ni-Kβ filter. The sample was ground into a fine powder with an agate mortar and pestle and analyzed on zero-background Si holders.
  </p>
  <h3>
   3.2 In Situ Powder Synchrotron XRD
  </h3>
  <p>
   A slice of Mg was cut from a piece of Mg turning and pushed to the bottom of a silica capillary (0.5 mm ID × 0.7 mm OD, Friedrich &amp; Dimmock, Inc.). About 10 mg of finely ground and homogeneous mixture of Si and As in stoichiometric ratio for Mg3Si6As8 was then added. The capillary was evacuated and flame sealed. Beamline 17-BM-B at Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab was used. The sample was loaded onto a flow cell equipped with electric heaters and exposed to synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.45336 Å). Data were collected during heating at 15 K min-1 until 1123 K, dwelled for 20 min at that temperature, and then cooled at 15-50 K min-1 to room temperature. Temperatures were calibrated by comparing the observed melting points of sealed capillary samples of elemental Sn, Sb, and Ge to their expected melting points. GSAS-II was used for data processing and analysis.
  </p>
  <h3>
   3.3 Single-Crystal XRD
  </h3>
  <p>
   Data collection for MgSiAs2 and Mg3Si6As8 was performed at 90 K on a Bruker AXS SMART diffractometer with an APEX-II CCD area detector and Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Raw data integration was performed with either the APEX2 or APEX3 software, and multiscan absorption corrections were applied. Crystal structure solution and refinement was carried out using the SHELX suite. MgSiAs2 was refined as a two-component twin. Data collection and structure refinement details are found in Table for MgSiAs2 (ICSD 434187) and Mg3Si6As8 (ICSD 434188). Crystal structure images were generated using VESTA.

   3.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
  </h3>
  <p>
   DSC measurements were executed using a Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter Differential Scanning Calorimeter for MgSiAs2 powder (15.6 mg) and a Netzsch 404 F3 Pegasus Differential Scanning Calorimeter for Mg3Si6As8 powder (15.5 mg). Finely ground powders were sealed in evacuated silica ampoules and heated to 1373 K and cooled to 323 K at a rate of 5 K min-1.
  </p>
  <h3>
   3.5 Electronic Structure Calculations
  </h3>
  <p>
   Electronic structure calculations and bonding analyses were carried out using the tight binding-linear muffin tin orbitals-atomic sphere approximation (TB-LMTO-ASA) program. The Barth-Hedin exchange potential was employed for local density approximation (LDA) calculations. The radial scalar-relativistic Dirac equation was solved to obtain the partial waves. The basis set used contained Mg(3s,3p), Si(3s,3p), and As(4s,4p) orbitals with downfolded Mg(3d), Si(3d), and As(4d) functions. The density of states (DOS), band structures, and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) were calculated after converging the total energy on a dense k-mesh of 12 × 12 × 12 points with 262 irreducible k-points for MgSiAs2 and 16 × 16 × 16 points with 200 irreducible k-points for Mg3Si6As8.
  </p>
  <h3>
   3.6 Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
  </h3>
  <p>
   Powders of MgSiAs2 and Mg3Si6As8 were pressed onto a glass slide wrapped with Teflon tape and white filter paper. A Thermo Scientific Evolution 220 spectrometer was used to obtain UV-vis diffuse reflectance data from 250 to 1100 nm, which were then converted by the Kubelka-Munk function. Additional measurements were performed using BLACK-Comet C-SR-100 spectrometer.
  </p>
  <h3>
   3.7 Powder SHG
  </h3>
  <p>
   The SHG response measurement was performed by the Kurtz and Perry method with a 2.09 µm Q-switch laser. The MgSiAs2 sample was finely ground and sieved to select particles in the 55-88 µm size range. Microcrystalline AgGaSe2 of the same particle size range was used as a reference. The samples were placed on a glass microscope cover slide, secured by a 1 mm thick silicone insole with an 8 mm diameter hole, and then covered with another glass slide. The samples were then placed into light-tight boxes and explored under a pulsed infrared beam from a Q-switched Ho:Tm:Cr:YAG laser with a wavelength of 2.09 µm. The SHG signals were recorded on the oscilloscope that was connected with the detector.
  </p>
  <h3>
   3.8 LDT Measurements
  </h3>
  <p>
   LDT was measured using a 1064 nm Q-switch laser on a ground powder of MgSiAs2 crystals and AgGaSe2 as a reference. The samples were surrounded by a 1 mm thick silicone pad with an 8 mm diameter hole and pressed between two glass slides. They were then fixed in a light-tight box with the plane surface explored under a pulsed laser beam (1064 nm, 10 ns). The pulse energy was raised from 0.2 mJ and stopped when obvious damage was discovered under a microscope after the irradiation.
  </p>
  <h2>
   4 Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h3>
   4.1 Synthesis
  </h3>
  <p>
   The synthesis of MgSiAs2 is challenging due to the low reactivity of Si versus the high reactivities and vapor pressure of Mg and As at elevated temperatures. Originally, a small red single crystal of MgSiAs2 was detected as a product of a reaction of Mg, Ge, and As in CsCl flux performed in a silica tube. Reduction of SiO2 with Mg is hypothesized to be the source of Si. Single phase powder of MgSiAs2 was then synthesized by repeatedly annealing and grinding stoichiometric amounts of the elements with a 20% molar excess of Mg to account for its evaporation and reaction with the silica ampoule (see the Experimental Section for details). The MgSiAs2 sample appeared to be a single phase after final acid treatment to remove traces of Mg3As2.
  </p>
  <p>
   Similar to the discovery of MgSiAs2, red single crystals of Mg3Si6As8 were initially found as a minor product during the optimization of the synthesis of a Cs-Ni-Si-As compound using Mg and CsCl flux. Large crystals of the compound can be grown from Bi flux together with side products of elemental Si along with binary admixtures. For the optimization of the reaction conditions for stoichiometric synthesis from elements, in situ powder XRD was applied. It revealed the formation of Mg3Si6As8 at 1150 K upon cooling of the melt (Figure ). A competing phase, SiAs, formed at higher temperatures during cooling, and elemental Si remained in the sample throughout the experiment. The temperature of formation of Mg3Si6As8 as detected by in situ powder XRD, 1150 K, is lower than the formation onset detected by DSC experiments, 1240 K. This discrepancy was observed for other pnictide containing systems. The best quality sample of Mg3Si6As8 was synthesized by repeatedly annealing and grinding stoichiometric amounts of the elements with a 33% molar excess of Mg (see the Experimental Section for details). Small admixtures of Si and SiAs remained in the sample, and further grindings and annealing were ineffective to increase phase purity. Adding more than 33% of Mg after the first annealing caused the reduction of Mg3Si6As8 into Si and SiAs as well as the appearance of Mg3As2.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.2 Thermal Stability
  </h3>
  <p>
   Differential scanning calorimetry experiments revealed that MgSiAs2 decomposed at 1140 K (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which was confirmed by annealing MgSiAs2 at 1200 K. The annealing resulted in a mixture of Mg3As2 and SiAs2. Mg3Si6As8 demonstrates higher thermal stability than MgSiAs2, as it melts or decomposes at 1240 K (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Powder XRD performed on the sample after the DSC run revealed that Mg3Si6As8 had partially degraded into a mixture of SiAs, SiAs2, As, and MgSiAs2.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.3 Chemical Stability
  </h3>
  <p>
   Both MgSiAs2 and Mg3Si6As8 can be left in air for a week without degradation, however several weeks exposure resulted in partial decomposition. A change in color was not evident in MgSiAs2 while single crystals of Mg3Si6As8 eventually lost their red clarity and attained a dull iridescent sheen. Powder XRD did not reveal any significant chemical change to Mg3Si6As8, suggesting slow surface oxidation occurred. MgSiAs2 was resistant to a 1 HCl:1 H2O treatment for 2 h. No change was observed for Mg3Si6As8 after overnight exposure to concentrated HCl and HNO3. When bathed in fresh aqua regia (1 HNO3:3 HCl) overnight, Mg3Si6As8 single crystals retained their shape, though a surface oxidation reaction may have occurred causing the crystal to visibly lose color from outside in. The resulting outer clear portion of the crystals was found to be amorphous and did not diffract X-rays.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.4 Crystal Structure
  </h3>
  <p>
   Following the trend of other II-IV-V2 compounds, MgSiAs2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I-42d (No. 122) in a chalcopyrite structure type (Figure a). In this compound, all atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated and each element has one unique position in the unit cell. Si is bonded to four As atoms, which are in turn bonded to two Si atoms and two Mg atoms. The As atoms form a distorted tetrahedron around Mg. Tetragonal distortion is very common among ternary chalcopyrite compounds and can be evaluated by the deviation of the lattice parameter ratio c/a from 2. In the case of MgSiAs2, the c/a ratio is 1.79, making the distortion comparable to that of AgGaS2. []
  </p>
  <p>
   Mg3Si6As8 crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric cubic space group P4332 (No. 207), Pearson symbol cP68 with Wyckoff sequence e2c2a. This space group/sequence combination is not yet listed in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), indicating that this is a new structure type. The structure consists of a complex Si-As framework with Mg cations interspersed within (Figure b). Mg has two distinct environments, surrounded by As in either a tetrahedral or an octahedral arrangement, which is also observed in R2Mg3SiAs6 (R = La, Ce). In the crystal structure of Mg3Si6As8, the Mg-centered polyhedra spiral along the 43 screw axes down the cardinal directions through the center of each face.
  </p>
  <p>
   While both crystal structures of Mg-Si-As compounds contain distorted Mg@As4 tetrahedra (Figure c), the Mg@As4 unit in MgSiAs2 is distorted through their bond angles, deviating 4°-10° from the ideal tetrahedral bond angle of 109.5° (Table S2, Supporting Information). In contrast, the distortion in Mg3Si6As8 is mainly due to the varied Mg-As bond distances of 2.690(1) and 2.5791(6) Å (Table S2, Supporting Information). The bond distances in these tetrahedra average out to the average Mg-As bond length found in Mg3As2 (2.64 Å). The distances in the Mg@As6 octahedra, 2.8541(4) Å, are much longer than those in the tetrahedra, but are comparable to distances in inorganic magnesium arsenides such as MgAs4 (2.71-2.92 Å), KMgAs (2.84 Å), Mg4Ir7As6 (2.90 Å), R2Mg3SiAs6 (2.69-2.86 Å), and KMg4As3.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Si-As framework in Mg3Si6As8 is similar to that in binary SiAs compound. In both cases, Si-Si dumbbells are surrounded by six As atoms. A 3D rhombus grid pattern of the Si2@As6 octahedra is created in the structure of Mg3Si6As8 (Figure a), while in the crystal structure of SiAs such octahedra form 2D layers (Figure b). Each Si atom is four-coordinated to three As atoms and another Si, while As is coordinated to either three or two Si atoms.

   4.5 Electronic and Optical Properties
  </h3>
  <p>
   According to electronic structure calculations, MgSiAs2 and Mg3Si6As8 are predicted to be direct or pseudo-direct bandgap semiconductors with 1.0 and 1.5 eV bandgaps, correspondingly (Figure and Figure S4, Supporting Information). The valence band of Mg3Si6As8 has four maxima of the same energy: two in Γ-R, one in Γ-X, and one in Γ-M regions. The conduction band has a clear single minimum at the R point. The energy difference between direct and indirect transitions is very small, 0.03 eV, which makes the compound a pseudo-direct bandgap semiconductor. For MgSiAs2 this prediction agrees with the bandgap energy calculated by Kocak et al. using the LDA method. [] Another computational work using the modified Beck Johnson potential (mBJ) predicts MgSiAs2 to be a direct semiconductor with a larger bandgap of 1.95 eV. [] For both compounds, As provides the highest contribution to the states in the top of the valence band, while the contributions of Mg and Si are comparable. The steep slopes of DOS at the Fermi level resembles Sb-containing thermoelectrics with high thermopower. Doping with a metal such as lithium may shift the compound into a heavily doped semiconductor state, which will be useful for an effective thermoelectric material.

   Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) is a computational tool for analysis of chemical bonding in solids with respect to the bonding and antibonding character of the electrons in their DOS. COHP partitions band-structure energy into orbital-pair interactions to estimate bond strengths. COHP calculations show that the interactions in MgSiAs2 and Mg3Si6As8 are optimized with bonding states below the Fermi level and antibonding states above the Fermi level (Figure ). Si-As and Si-Si interactions are the strongest as compared to Mg-As interactions in both compounds (Table ). Bonding within the Mg@As4 tetrahedra is stronger in Mg3Si6As8 as given by its larger integrated COHP (-ICOHP) value of 4.71 eV/polyhedron compared to that in MgSiAs2 with 3.41 eV/polyhedron. Within the Mg@As4 tetrahedron in Mg3Si6As8, the longer Mg1-As1 bond (2.69 Å) has an expected weaker orbital overlap, 1.19 eV/bond, as compared to the three other Mg1-As2 bonds in the tetrahedron, 1.76 eV/bond for the distance of 2.58 Å. The latter distance and orbital overlap are comparable to those in the Mg@As4 tetrahedron in MgSiAs2, 1.71 eV/bond for the distance of 2.61 Å. The increase of Mg-As distances in the Mg@As6 octahedron to 2.85 Å leads to an expected weakening of the orbital overlap down to 0.87 eV/bond (Figure 6, Table ).

   To characterize the optical bandgap, solid-state UV-vis spectroscopy was performed (Figure ). Tauc plots generated from the Kubelka-Munk data revealed a direct bandgap of 1.83(5) eV for MgSiAs2 and 2.02(8) eV for Mg3Si6As8, which corresponds to the red color of both compounds. Several measurements on different batches of Mg3Si6As8 were attempted, and all were of similar quality (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The experimental bandgap values are higher than the calculated ones, though it is common for LDA calculation techniques to underestimate the actual value of the bandgap. The trend predicted by the electronic structure calculations was experimentally confirmed in which the bandgap for MgSiAs2 is smaller than that for Mg3Si6As8. Indirect bandgap values cannot be accurately determined probably due to significant contribution from defect scattering as observed by large Urbach tails.

   4.6 Second Harmonic Generation and Laser Damage Threshold
  </h3>
  <p>
   By means of the Kurtz and Perry method, a strong powder SHG response from MgSiAs2 was detected on the level of 0.6 times that of benchmark IR-SHG material, AgGaS2 (Figure ) under a 2.09 µm primary source. Note that MgSiAs2 powder SHG response may be seriously weakened by its narrow optical bandgap (1.83 eV) and long shortwave absorption edge (up to 1 µm). We believe that the precise SHG effect may be obtained by a long wavelength laser (e.g.. carbon dioxide laser) for MgSiAs2 similar to how CdGeAs2 exhibits large NLO efficiency (236 pm V-1) when exposed to a longer excitation wavelength ( > 2.5 µm). Thus, we consider MgSiAs2 to be a promising IR-NLO material given a suitable pump source.
  </p>
  <p>
   The LDT of MgSiAs2 was evaluated by adjusting the laser output energy and looking for color change using an optical microscope. Results show that MgSiAs2 exhibits comparable LDT (33.2 MW cm-2) with that of AgGaS2 (29.6 MW cm-2) (Table ) as well as those of other typical IR-NLO crystals, such as AgGaSe2 or ZnGeP2. In order to further evaluate the application prospect for MgSiAs2, a growth of large single crystal and properties evaluations at different excitation wavelength are underway.

   Ground crystals of Mg3Si6As8 were also measured, but no SHG signal was detected as expected for the compound crystallizing in the 432 crystal class. This crystal class exhibits optical activity, but it is the only non-centrosymmetric crystal class that does not exhibit SHG. Trace Bi may have remained on the surface of the crystals despite multiple acid etches, but its presence is not expected to alter the results.

   5 Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   As an unexplored ternary system, Mg-Si-As exhibits a high tendency of forming NCS crystal structures, which is interesting for crystallographic study and NLO applications. MgSiAs2 belongs to the well-known II-IV-VI2 NLO structure type, while Mg3Si6As8 crystallizes in a new non-centrosymmetric crystal structure type. Computational and optical investigations revealed direct bandgap semiconductor properties for MgSiAs2, 1.83(5) eV, and Mg3Si6As8, 2.02(8) eV. Notably, MgSiAs2 presents a good balance between the SHG coefficient and laser damage threshold. While Mg3Si6As8 does not show nonlinear optical activity, as expected due to its 432 Laue class, MgSiAs2 exhibits a strong SHG response that is 0.6 times that of state-of-the-art AgGaS2. MgSiAs2 also exhibits a higher LDT compared to that of AgGaS2, 33.2 MW cm-2 versus 29.6 MW cm-2. Single crystal growth is important for further evaluation of its NLO application and is an undergoing study. We have also engaged in efforts to increase the bandgap of the Mg-Si-As system, such as replacing Mg with more electropositive cations, to create novel NCS compounds. Although Mg3Si6As8 cannot be used for second harmonic generation devices, electronic structure calculations indicate it may become a viable thermoelectric material upon p-type doping.
