Doomes and McGuire391 reported their work on ion beam sputtered multilayer SiO2/Ta2O5 coatings on fused SiO2 substrates. XAS gave chemical and structural features of the dielectric multilayered NO2/Ta2O5 mirror coatings. Rajput et al.392 studied the depth resolved structural information of heavy ion induced phase formation in Si/Fe/Si trilayers. XRF measurements gave the Fe depth distribution, whilst Mossbauer spectroscopy and XAFS provided information about changes in local structure. Synthesis and characterisation of a new four-layer Aurivillius phase Bi2SrNa2Nb4O15 was reported by Liang et al.393 Following a solid state reaction of Bi2SrNa2Nb4O9 and NaNbO3 at 1100 °C, XRD was used to show the resultant crystalline structure and XRF and thermogravimetry used for the measurement of composition the multilayers formed.",

                "text": "India is involved in the preparation of LMT powder by two different routes. (I) In the Solution Combustion Synthesis Process (SCSP), TiO2 is used as a precursor material instead of costly precursors like TiCl4 or Ti-isopropoxide and Li2CO3 is used as the lithium source. First, titanium sulphate is formed by the reaction of titania in sulphuric acid (H2SO4), which can be enhanced by adding ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4. In a later stage, titanium sulphate is converted to Ti-nitrate solution by the precipitation with ammonia solution and dissolution in nitric acid. Using the stable Ti-nitrate solution and citric acid as a fuel/complexing agent in controlled amounts, nanoparticles of LMT have been successfully synthesized by the citrate–nitrate auto-combustion route [6]. It was observed that the microstructure of the sintered specimen strongly depends on the sintering temperature. The thermal expansion coefficient of the sintered specimens was investigated by dilatometry in air and was found to be around 19 × 10−6 K−1. The thermal diffusivity of 1173 K sintered samples, measured by the laser flash method, was about 2.5 W/m K [7]. (II) In the solid state reaction, Li2TiO3 is synthesized from a mixture of Li2CO3 and TiO2, and calcined at 1173 K for 24 h. The fused mass is subsequently milled [8]. In both cases, pebbles are fabricated by extrusion and spheronization and subsequently sintered at 1173 K. The process details of SCSP and the solid state route are given in Fig. 1. In India, LMT pebbles were also prepared by a sol–gel route, in which a gel of Ti(OH)4 and Li2O is prepared from an aqueous solution of TiOCl2, LiNO3, hexa-methylene-tetra-amine (HTMA), and urea at 273–277 K (0–4 °C). The gel is then washed with an aqueous solution of NH4OH. Dried gel pebbles were calcined and sintered at 1273 K.",

                "text": "LMT has been recognized as one of the primary candidates for tritium breeding materials. Additions of H2 to the purge gas were proposed for enhancing the release of the generated tritium from the breeder material. However, LMT is reduced in a H2 atmosphere at an operating temperature above 873K, which will lead to degradation of the tritium release characteristics. The reduction of Ti from Ti4+ to Ti3+ is accompanied by a mass decrease due to a decrease in the oxygen content [1]. Thus in Japan, the development of LMT with additional Li was attempted to improve its resistance to deoxidization at high temperatures. However, it turned out that an excess of lithium in LMT is difficult to realize by solid state reactions [2] as well as by using lithium and titanium alkoxides as raw materials [3], as prevalently Li4TiO4 is formed as an impurity. Hence, LMT with additional Li was synthesized from LiOH H2O and H2TiO3 with a Li/Ti ratio of 2.2. Mixtures of the starting powders were continuously rotated for 48h and gradually turned into a gel by solid phase reaction at room temperature [4]. After drying, the gel is first calcined in air, and then sintered at 1473K for 1h in N2. For the mixing of powder and binder, a jet grinding method turned out to be favorable in terms of dispersion compared to dry mixing. The sol-gel method was selected for the pebble fabrication technique of advanced tritium breeders [5]. The gel-spheres were calcined at 973K for 6h in air, and sintered at 1373K for 1h in Ar. The diameter of the LMT pebbles with additional Li is about 1.2mm, the sphericity is 1.04, and the density of the pebbles is ⩾89% TD (theoretical density).",

To save on experimental cost, zirconia crucibles are used as melting crucibles. The crucible holds lithium carbonate and silica as raw materials, which react and melt, when heated by an electric furnace, to form liquid LOS. The pebbles are fabricated by quenching droplets to room temperature. They are subsequently annealed at 1273K for 2h to heal microcracks and to relieve internal stress. Due to the rapid cooling, the pebbles exhibit a dendritic microstructure on the surface (Fig. 2 ) and in cross-sections. After annealing, Li4SiO4 was observed as the main phase and Li2SiO3 as the minor phase by XRD. The second phase is due to the evaporation of lithium at high temperature, as the ratio of lithium to silicon is difficult to control [15]. A mean value of 7N was obtained for the crush load in experiments of 40 single pebbles with a diameter of 1mm. To improve the mechanical properties, a series of tests with pebbles of different compositions treated in an optimized annealing process will be investigated in the future.",

Note that an excess amount of CsNO3 (25 mol %) was added to compensate for the loss of Cs by volatilization. After manual dry mixing in the glovebox, the mixture was put into a platinum crucible and closed loosely with a platinum lid. The mixture-containing platinum crucible was then placed in a high-temperature electric muffle furnace, heated to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 50 °C·h–1, held at this temperature for 6 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 150 °C·h–1.

For example, the hexagonal lead-tantalate phases Pb1.5Ta7O19 and PbTa4O11 were discovered by flux-mediated lead-exchange reactions starting from the Cu3Ta7O19 and A2Ta4O11 (A = Na, Ag) parent structures and a PbCl2 flux at 800 °C and 700 °C, respectively. These lead tantalate phases could only be achieved by lead-exchange reactions using a PbCl2 flux in vacuum sealed fused-silica tubes. Solid-state syntheses and lead-exchange reactions of A2Ta4O11 (A = Na, Ag) using PbCl2 in air instead yielded the PbTa2O6 and Pb3Ta4O13 phases, respectively.27,117 Lead-exchange reactions under vacuum and in air yielded rod- and octahedron-shaped morphologies for PbTa4O11 and Pb3Ta4O13 phases, respectively. The fast growth of Am+2/mTa4O11 along the c axis results in rod-shaped particles, as shown in Fig. 10. The PbTa4O11 phase exhibits a bandgap size of ~3.8 eV,27 which is ~0.5 eV smaller in energy than that found for Na2Ta4O11 at ~4.3 eV.19 A reduction in the band gap was also observed with an increase in the Pb(ii) content as a result of the flux exchange, and which served to increase the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen and oxygen production. The PbTa4O11 phase was reported with a photocatalytic activity of ~175 μmol H2 g−1 h−1 in aqueous methanol under ultraviolet and visible irradiation, while the solid-state prepared precursor Ag2Ta4O11 had a rate of ~23 μmol H2 g−1 h−1. The PbTa4O11 phase generated ~181 μmol O2 g−1 h−1 in aqueous silver nitrate under ultraviolet and visible irradiation, while its precursor Ag2Ta4O11 exhibited a similar rate of ~165 μmol O2 g−1 h−1. Higher activity for water reduction was found for layered tantalate structures comprised of TaO7 pentagonal bipyramid layers, which can serve as extended charge-migration pathways.",

                "text": "The reduction process of CuFe2O4-based spinel was schematically shown in Fig. 17 . As previously reported [7,13,17], the sample pre-calcined in air below 900°C was less active for methanol steam reforming step (1) in DME SR than those heated at 900°C and 1000°C. The BET surface area after heating at or higher than 900°C was very small (ca. 1m2 g-1). The particles are grown in size during complete solid state reaction between copper oxide and iron oxide to form CuFe2O4 spinel. During the calcination in air at elevated temperatures, the Cu and Fe atoms are accommodated to respective cationic sites in the spinel structure; i.e.. atomic dispersion was achieved at this stage. The oxidation states of copper and iron are di- and tri-valent, respectively. After reduction with hydrogen at 250°C or 350°C, however, these oxidation states are no longer stable. Copper is readily reduced to metallic state and iron oxide to Fe3O4 with inverse spinel structure. Metallic iron was also observed for the sample reduced at 350°C, though the fraction was small. Formation of these phases accompanies separation of two components and volume shrinkage. The large extent of textural modification and the pore formation were observed by TEM. The comparison of the reduced samples at 250°C and 350°C clearly indicated that, upon reduction, the phase separation and pore formation were progressed. This microstructural change agreed with that of surface area upon reduction. Deposited Cu grains should be small in size at the initial stage of the reduction, but grown in size with a further progress of reduction. However, strong chemical interaction of deposited Cu and the host spinel oxide could be expected from this study. Thus, the Cu deposits remain small in size as compared with the Cu catalysts prepared by impregnation on an inert support. The growth of the Cu particles is one of the main causes of the degradation in Cu-based catalysts for DME reforming. The main factors for deactivation of CuFe2O4 +γ-alumina are deposition of carbonaceous species and sintering of Cu. Especially, in the reaction at or higher than 350°C, thermal degradation with sintering is dominated. Therefore, the preparation of Cu catalyst from the spinel oxide via phase separation should be effective in maintaining the fine metallic state of Cu, though the overall BET surface area is small.",

In the first step analytically-pure oxides, PbO, ZrO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, Ta2O5, and Nb2O5 (Alfa Aesar) with purity of 99–99.9%, were used as starting materials. The powders of the respective metal oxides were homogeneously mixed using a planetary high energy ball mill with tungsten carbide media under isopropanol at a speed of 600 rpm for a period of 16 h, then from the resulting slurry the solvent was slowly evaporated until a mixed powder was obtained. For phase formation the resultant powders were calcined at 850 °C for 10 h in a closed alumina crucible. 10% excess of PbO was to compensate Pb deficiency during the high temperature processing. In the second step, the calcined powder was mixed with a 1% poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) solution as a binder and the dried powders were granulated by passing them through a 150 μm-mesh sieve. They were then pressed using a hydrostatic press (3.46 × 108 Pa) into 2 mm thick disk with a diameter of 10 mm. The pressed pellets were heat treated at 600 °C for 2 h for the removal of organic binder, followed by sintering at 1250 °C for 4 h. All heat treatments were performed in air. In order to prevent the PbO loss during high temperature sintering and to maintain the desired stoichiometry, an equilibrium PbO vapor pressure was established by placing PbZrO3 along with the samples in a covered alumina crucible.

The two starting reactants respond differently to microwave irradiation, where SnO strongly couples under microwave energy while TiO2 does not. The reaction mechanism is suggested to proceed with the diffusion of the hot Sn2+ species toward TiO2 to form Sn2TiO4. The authors reported that a drastic enhancement of the reaction kinetics could be achieved under thermal non-equilibrium conditions induced by the strong coupling of SnO with microwave energy.52 This was shown to be advantageous to synthesize Sn2+ compounds, avoiding the disproportionation reaction. Although the photocatalytic properties of Sn2TiO4 have not yet been reported, many theoretical works have predicted its good intrinsic properties that would enable it to act as a visible light-responsive material. The electronic structure of Sn2TiO4 is calculated by using DFT with the PBE functional and a plane wave basis set, employing the VASP code.130,131 At this level of theory, the band gap is underestimated at 1.16 eV, but using the more accurate HSE06 functional, a separation of 2.09 eV is predicted between the valence and conduction bands",

The aqueous titania sol (AA-sol) was prepared by mixing TIPT, an aqueous solution of acac, and an aqueous solution of AcOH.27 The AA-sol was mixed with an aqueous solution containing both Sr(OAc)2 (1.08 mol L−1) and lactic acid (2.16 mol L−1) and an aqueous solution of RhCl3 (0.24 mol L−1) at a ratio of Sr : Ti : Rh = 1.02 : 0.98 : 0.02, and stirred for 1 hour at room temperature, yielding an orange transparent sol. To the sol was added an acrylic emulsion and it was stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature, then dried at 80 °C for 3 hours, and finally calcined at 1000 °C for 10 hours, yielding SrTiO3:Rh (Rh: 2%) powdered samples (these samples are denoted as WH-particles). For comparison, SrTiO3:Rh(2%) particles were also prepared via the solid state reaction method (SS-method) using TiO2, SrCO3 and Rh2O3 as raw materials, and calcination at 1000 °C for 10 hours (these samples will be denoted by SS-particles) followed. Although some reports have suggested that the addition of excess Sr in the preparation of SrTiO3-based particles via the SS-method is effective to obtain more active photocatalyst samples, we confirmed that the SrTiO3:Rh particles prepared via the SS-method with excess amount of Sr (Sr/(Ti + Rh) = 1.03, for example) showed almost same rate of H2 evolution as that on the sample prepared with the stoichiometric ratio.28 Thus, in the present study, the SrTiO3:Rh particles prepared via the SS-method with stoichiometric ratio (Sr:(Ti + Rh) = 1) was employed as the almost best SS-sample for fabricating SrTiO3:Rh films for comparison. As an effective cocatalyst for water reduction, small amount (0.5 wt%) of platinum particles were loaded on all the samples by means of in situ photodeposition method.",

The as-prepared LiMn2O4 powder was stirred into this solution at 50 °C for 30 min. The resulting suspension was spray dried with inlet and outlet temperatures maintained at 200 and 110 °C, respectively. The dried powders were fired at 750 °C for 2 h in an oxygen atmosphere. The coating accounted for 5 wt% of the resultant material, denoted CoLMO. For pellet density calculations, 2 g of active material was added to a stainless steel cylinder and subjected to a pressure of 200 bar.",

The ingots were remelted twice to ensure homogeneity. Mechanical milling was carried out with normal butane protection at 200 rpm for 4 h. The powders were then sintered by SPS (SPS-1050, Sumitomo Coal Mining Co.) at 1175 K under 65 MPa in vacuum for 10 min. The as-sintered samples, of which the relative density was found to be ≈95%, were used for measurements of thermal conductivity and Hall data, and then cut into rectangular bars for Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity measurements.",
